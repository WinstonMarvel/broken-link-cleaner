BODY:


<p>Suffering an injury on the job can lead to a lifetime of pain, stress and other issues. Not all workplace injuries or illnesses will cause you to miss work for the rest of your life, but some people do experience such an injury. So, what happens if you are unable to return to work due to an injury?</p>

<p>One of the first things that the Social Security Administration (SSA) will do is evaluate your injury and determine if it prevents you from handling the mental and physical capacities of your last job before the injury. If it is deemed that you are not fit to return to this type of employment, the agency will then figure out if you have the education and skills required to work another job.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The SSA will make a determination on employment in another type of job. If the agency determines that you won't be able to handle another type of job, either due to your injury or education, they will note that you are unable to return to work. This will lead to the agency issuing disability benefits. If this is the case, you will likely be receiving the benefits through a medical vocational allowance.</p>

<p>Since the agency makes the determination on every case, it's incredibly important that you complete any employment questionnaires correctly. Never minimize the requirements of any job you performed prior to your injury. An attorney can help you complete these forms correctly.</p>

<p>An attorney experienced in Social Security Disability claims can provide help if you've suffered an injury on the job and are unable to return to the workforce.</p>

BODY:


<p>Adults and children who are disabled and have limited income resources can apply for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) from the Social Security Administration (SSA). These benefits can also be paid out to seniors over the age of 65 who meet the financial requirements even if they are not disabled. This program is funded by revenue from general taxes, not Social Security tax.</p>

<p>Depending on your age or situation you might be able to apply for these benefits online. To qualify for an online application, you must meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Be between the ages of 18-65</li>
	<li>Have not received SSI benefits in the past</li>
	<li>Have not applied for SSI benefits in the past</li>
	<li>Have not been married</li>
	<li>Are not blind</li>
	<li>Reside in any of the 50 states, the District of Columbia or the Northern Mariana islands</li>
	<li>Submitting an application for Social Security Disability insurance at the same time as SSI</li>
</ul>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>When you are done submitting your application online, a representative from the SSA will contact you should the agency require any further information. If you do not meet the online application requirements, you can complete an application in person at a local SSA office. If you are denied in your attempt to acquire SSI, it's best to file an appeal with the help of an attorney.</p>

<p>Living with a disability that prevents you from working, or limiting the amount of time you can work, is a challenging situation. With the help of the SSA, you can apply for and receive benefits if you have limited income. It's best to understand the process and know your rights when applying for <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Supplemental-Security-Income-SSI.shtml">Supplemental Security Income in Indianapolis</a>.</p>

<p>Life is difficult enough for those who are prevented from working by a disability. They really do not need government inefficiency and red tape to add to their problems. But the backlog in the Social Security Administration's claims and appeals process is making life miserable for many people who <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/" >deserve Social Security Disability Insurance benefits</a>.</p>
<p>Some U.S. Senators say that a recently passed appropriations bill could make matters even worse.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>“We are concerned that the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies (LHHS) appropriations bill recently reported by the full Appropriations committee reduces SSA’s administrative budget by almost $460 million,” said Senator Ron Wyden.</p>
<p>He and other senators are urging colleagues to ramp up spending for Social Security: not to increase benefits, but to speed the appeals process for those making SSD/SSDI claims. The current backlog in that process means that the average wait time is approximately 600 days, or nearly two years.</p>
<p>Wyden said that this is no time to increase the time workers with disabilities have to wait for the benefits that they have paid for. He said the Social Security Administration "cannot make significant progress at <a href="http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2017/10/19/social-security-disability-appeals-piling-up-due-t" target="_blank" >reducing the disability hearings backlog</a> without adequate resources," especially with newspaper headlines pointing out that people are dying while waiting for benefits approval.</p>
<p>An SSDI appeal is critical, which is why it is so important to have on your side an attorney experienced with both the process and paperwork. In Indianapolis, you can contact The Law Office of Jim McKown for more information.</p>

<p>The inability to work can be a very stressful situation for people of any age.

One way you can still receive compensation is to file for disability benefits in Indiana. Here are some tips for filing so you can receive compensation.</p>

<p>Before you file for disability, you should download and review the Adult Disability Checklist published by the Social Security Administration (SSA). This checklist is found on their website. The checklist will provide guidance on what information you will need in order to file for disability depending on the disability you have.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Once you review the checklist, you can complete the Disability Benefit Application, which can also be found on the SSA website. When you file for disability benefits, you will need to provide your name, Social Security number, date of birth, the same information of your spouse, names and birth dates of children and banking information for electronic deposit.</p>
<p>You will also need to provide information about your medical condition, contact info for your doctor and list of medications you have been prescribed for your condition. The application will also ask you for employment information regarding your income last year, contact information for your most recent employer, a copy of a Social Security Statement and a list of jobs you held prior to getting sick.</p>

<p>From a construction worker who has worked construction for 30 years to a 20-year veteran nurse, many residents who live in and around the Indianapolis metro have jobs that are physically demanding. Even in cases where an individual is fortunate enough to escape suffering a serious work accident or major injury, over time,  repetitive movements like bending, lifting, twisting and even standing for long periods of time can lead to painful and debilitating injuries and conditions that can make it difficult to impossible to work.</p>
<p>If you spent decades working hard to provide for yourself and your family and are now suffering an impairing medical condition such as chronic back or nerve pain, rheumatoid arthritis or chronic bronchitis, you may qualify to receive Social Security Disability benefits.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Unfortunately, a large percentage of individuals who apply for SSD benefits, discover the hard way that the complex and frustrating process, it also often fruitless. In fact, according to the Social Security Administration, only 36 percent of first-time SSD applicants are successful in security benefits. Thankfully, if you are among the 64 percent of <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10041.pdf" target="_blank" >SSD applicants whose initial claims are denied</a>, you can appeal your denial.</p>
<p><strong>Appealing Your SSD Denial</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reconsideration</strong> — During the first level of a SDD appeal, you essentially request that your application be reviewed and considered by another employee at the Social Security Administration. Only roughly 10 percent of denied claims that are submitted for reconsideration are successful.</li>
<li><strong>Administrative Hearing</strong> — If reconsideration is not successful, you can request a hearing before an administrative judge who will review all of the information that was included in your initial application as well as any new evidence you choose to introduce.</li>
<li><strong>Review By Appeals Council</strong> — When an administrative hearing does not result in benefits being awarded, you can request that your case be reviewed by the Social Security Appeals Council. It’s important to know, however, that not all review requests are granted and the Appeals Council can decide to let the administrative hearing decision stand.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Court Review</strong> — In cases where the Appeals Council refuses to review your case or you disagree with their ruling, you can take your case to federal court.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />If your initial SSD application was denied, there is still hope. Often individuals who should qualify for benefits don’t because their applications were incomplete or their doctor failed to adequately document their disabling injury or condition. If you plan to <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Disability-Claim-Appeals/" >appeal your SSD denial</a>, it’s wise to seek advice from an attorney. An attorney who is well-versed in SSD matters can review your initial application and denial, answer your questions and work to secure the information and documents you need to obtain benefits.</p>

<p>Social Security is a term just about everyone knows off the top of their head. From the very first paycheck you earn, you start paying into Social Security. That's why you should familiarize yourself with common terms related to Social Security.</p>

<p>Social Security credits are earned as you work. They help you receive benefits should you ever need them. If you were born after 1929, you need to accrue 40 credits during your career in order to receive benefits when you retire. You can only accrue a maximum of four credits per year of work.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Delayed retirement credits can be accrued if you wait to file for retirement until after your full retirement age. If you accrue these added credits it will help to boost your retirement benefits. You will receive an eight percent increase in payments for each year you wait to file for retirement benefits.</p>

<p>The cost-of-living-adjustment, or COLA, is used to help those retired retain their ability to purchase items despite inflation. The COLA ensures that a person's retirement benefit increase from year to year if there are fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index.</p>

<p>AIME is short for average indexed monthly earnings. This is the calculation of the amount of payments you will receive monthly. The amount is based on your highest earnings from 35 years of employment. The earnings are adjusted to match inflation so they don't drop in value.</p>

<p>Do you need assistance filing for Social Security disability benefits or filing an appeal after being denied benefits? An experienced <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/" >Social Security disability attorney</a> in Indianapolis can help you with your case.</p>

<p>So much work and time went into building your claim for Social Security Disability (SSD) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, which makes it discouraging when your claim gets denied. Even more time and documentation goes into a request for reconsideration of your claim.</p>
<p>What happens if your reconsideration is denied as well? Fortunately, it is not the end of the road for your application. Here’s what happens after the denial of your reconsideration, and how you can be best prepared for what follows.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Request a Hearing</strong></p>
<p>The next step in the claim determination process is a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-11008.pdf" target="_blank" > a disability hearing</a>. The request must happen within 60 days of receiving your reconsideration denial to be valid. If you fail to request a hearing within that time, you must start the whole application process again for benefit consideration.</p>
<p><strong>A New Perspective</strong></p>
<p>An administrative law judge conducts the disability hearing. No longer controlled by SSDI claims officials, your case will be examined and considered by the judge, who will decide to accept or deny your claim.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation Tips</strong></p>
<p>Here are some tips that can facilitate a successful hearing process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look through your claim package and evidence, making sure it’s complete and organized.</li>
<li>Make sure to update medical information if necessary.</li>
<li>Send your evidence package to the judge hearing your case as soon as possible before your hearing.</li>
<li>Be ready for questions from the judge about your claim information and evidence.</li>
<li>Make sure to arrive at your hearing on time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Appeals </strong><strong>Council Review </strong><strong>And</strong><strong> Federal C</strong><strong>ourt</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to have your claim for SSD or SSI reconsidered at several levels. If you’re not satisfied with the hearing judge’s decision, you can take your case to an appeals council review. If you disagree with the review, you can take your case to Federal court.</p>
<p><strong>Consider Representation</strong></p>
<p>It may be advisable in your situation to obtain representation for your case. Experienced legal counsel can break through all of the <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/" >complexity of appealing a claim</a> and pave the way for a favorable decision in your case.</p>

<p>According to the Washington Post, 10,000 people who applied for Social Security Disability (SSD) died waiting to hear if they qualified. Many others will have to wait almost 600 days to hear how their case will be decided.</p>

<p>The backlog nationwide is affecting more than a million people. For one man who became legally blind after suffering an eye infection, the delay is far too long.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The man was a truck driver when he contracted the infection. He thought he would qualify for disability benefits, which he needs in order to keep his farm. His first claim for benefits was denied, though. Then he learned that it could take 18 months or longer to get a decision on his appeal.</p>

<p>Back in 2013, it took an average of 382 days to get a decision on an appeal. Now it's more than 590 days -- or more than 19 months -- in 2017.</p>

<p>What is the reason for the backlog? According to what government officials told Congress, it's due to a shortage of Social Security Administrative Law judges and their support staff. More money is needed to pay for the judges and their staff, but Congress didn't pass a new budget before they adjourned this week.</p>

<p>Those who apply for SSD benefits can't apply for unemployment, either. By applying for that benefit, they are telling the state that they can work. Applying for SSD benefits tells the government that the applicants can't work.</p>

<p>If you apply for <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">Social Security Disability benefits</a> and are denied, an experienced attorney can help you file an appeal. However, it does seem as though you may need a lot of patience before learning of the government's decision.</p>

<p>Many applications for disability benefits are denied not because the person does not deserve them, but because the application doesn't provide all of the proper information. Small paperwork mistakes can make a huge difference.</p>

<p>This also causes some people to give up. They get rejected and assume there's nothing they can do, when the reality is that they just got rejected over a typo or one critical piece of information they forgot to write down.</p>

	<li>The same information regarding children and your spouse.</li>

	<li>Banking information, including a routing number.</li>
	<li>Specific information about your medical condition.</li>
	<li>What medications you're taking.</li>

	<li>Dates of treatment.</li>
	<li>Names of medical centers.</li>
	<li>Patient ID numbers.</li>
	<li>Names and contact information for any other medical professionals who work with you.</li>
	<li>Your recent income, both for the past year and the current year.</li>
	<li>Jobs you worked in before the disability. List up to five jobs over 15 years.</li>
	<li>Current contact information for your employer.</li>
	<li>Exactly what benefits you're hoping to get and the reason you're filing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that this is not a comprehensive list.

<p>One of the most challenging aspects of successfully receiving Social Security Disability benefits is being able to successful prove your disability on the application. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is inundated with applications, receiving over two million of them each year. Therefore, it is crucial that your application meets all the needed criteria, otherwise you will be forced to appeal the result.</p>

<p>It can prove challenging to give enough evidence about the nature of your disability and the way that it affects your life. This is why it is a great idea for you to speak to your doctors and ask their advice on what information they think should be provided in the application form.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>When you meet with your doctors</strong></p>

<p>You should always have a meeting with your doctors before filling in your Social Security Disability benefits application form. They will be able to give very specific advice on your condition, whether it should affect your work or your ability to find work, and what type of information you should include within the application form.</p>

<p><strong>What your doctor must provide</strong></p>

<p>You doctor must always provide the SSA with a note that outlines your condition along with the way that it affects your life. This should also include a prognosis so that the SSA knows how long you are likely to be suffering from your condition.</p>

<p>Communicating well with your doctor is vital if you want to have a <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Working-With-Your-Doctor/">successful Social Security Disability benefits application.</a> Make sure that you ask them any questions that you have, and combine this with your own research.</p>

<p>You may have spent most of your life trying to understand your mental illness, and now you feel like you have to convince the rest of the world how serious it can be. If you suffer from bipolar disorder or another chronic affective disorder, you know how it can interfere with every aspect of your life. It may disrupt relationships, taint your interests and hinder you from making plans for the future.</p>
<p>A mental illness may also make it difficult to hold down a job. You may have depressive or manic phases that make concentrating on workplace tasks next to impossible. You may be fortunate if doctors have found medications that works well for controlling your symptoms, but, while medications are improving, many of them have side effects that can be debilitating. For this reason, you may be wondering how to <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Physical-Mental-Impairments/Listings-of-Impairments.shtml">apply for Social Security Disability</a>.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Qualifying for Social Security benefits</strong></p>
<p>The sad fact is that obtaining SSD benefits for a chronic affective disorder is very difficult and complicated. Nevertheless, about 45 percent of those who obtain benefits suffer from a mental health issue. A successful application requires intense documentation and the medical opinions of specialists. The advocacy of a legal professional is often helpful as well.</p>
<p>Some of the requirements for eligibility for SSD benefits for a mental illness include evidence of persistent episodes of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significant depression</li>
<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
<li>Suicidal thoughts</li>
<li>Paranoia</li>
<li>Delusions or hallucinations</li>
<li>Hyperactivity</li>
<li>Racing thoughts</li>
<li>Risky behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only a few of the symptoms you may deal with on a daily basis. If you have suffered with the symptoms of a mental illness for two years or more, and your illness has limited your ability to complete basic and essential duties in a work environment, you may be eligible for SSD benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Someone who understands you</strong></p>
<p>Obtaining those benefits can make a tremendous difference in your life. Many in your situation find it advantageous to have a legal professional to guide them through the SSD application process to reduce the chances of delays and rejections.</p>
<p>Because you have spent your life fighting to <a href="https://www.verywell.com/bipolar-disorder-disability-qualify-379886" target="_blank">get the help you need for your mental health</a>, you likely don't want to struggle to make yourself understood by a legal advocate. This is why you would certainly benefit from the assistance of an Indiana attorney who has experience helping those dealing with mental health issues.</p>

<p>The duration of your injury is one of the defining factors of whether or not your Social Security disability claim continues to move through the determination process. Even if your impairment is severe, a successful application must also provide comprehensive and convincing documentation related to the duration of your impairment.</p>
<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) measures duration by taking both the severity and length of your injury into consideration. The evidence and testimony provided both in documentation and in answers to inquiries at a disability determination hearing, factor heavily in whether you have a chance to qualify for disability benefits.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The SSA specifies the following criteria when determining adequate duration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expectation that the injury will eventually result in death</li>
<li>The disability has lasted over a year or is expected to last over a year</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of duration is also an important factor in two other components of the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/rsnotes/rsn2013-01.html" target="_blank" >disability evaluation process</a> performed by the SSA to determine the acceptance or denial of claims. These segments are vocational history and residual function.</p>
<p><strong>Medical and Vocational Considerations</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to gauge whether or not an applicant may still be able to work in some capacity, an applicant’s previous education and work experience are considered in tandem with his or her age and the severity of the impairment.</p>
<p><strong>Residual Functional Capacity</strong></p>
<p>You may have a severe accident injury, but if you are physically and mentally able to work in any position that you held in the last 15 years, you are not eligible for disability.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/" > for your disability</a> is an important factor in whether or not your claim is accepted. You may want to make sure that you complete your paperwork properly by consulting a professional experienced in Social Security disability claims.</p>

<p>Suffering an injury or illness that puts you out of work for any amount of time can be overwhelming. You might not know where the money will come from when it's time to pay the bills. You might also begin to pile up debt due to being out of work. This is a situation that can wreak havoc on your emotions and cause quite a bit of stress. Be sure you ask yourself the following questions prior to filing for Social Security disability.</p>

<p>When should I apply for benefits? You should apply for benefits when you no longer can work due to your condition. If you have enough medical evidence to support your claim, it's best to apply in order to get the ball rolling.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Who can apply for benefits? Anyone who suffers and illness or injury that will prevent them from working for a period of at least 12 months should apply for disability benefits from the Social Security Administration.</p>

<p>How do I apply for benefits? You can apply by yourself, but most people who do so typically have their claim denied the first time and have to file a subsequent time. You also have the option of filing using the help of a Social Security attorney.</p>

<p>Why should I apply for benefits? You should apply for benefits because you likely need the income on a month-to-month basis due to being out of work. You receive extra benefits if you have dependents under the age of 18 living in your home.</p>

<p>If you are applying for Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits, one of the first things you need to understand is that the average wait for a hearing is two years.</p>

<p>That's one of the most difficult aspects of the process for applicants to digest and accept. After all, if you are <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">making application for SSD benefits</a>, you are already unable to work and suffering from a condition that limits your abilities to carry out your normal activities of daily life.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>If depression wasn't one of your health issues prior to learning this, it could soon develop. Americans have a right to question why this vital process takes so long.</p>

<p>The answer to this question is that bureaucratic backlog slows the clock considerably. The backlog is due to — as so many things are — a dearth of Congressional funding for Social Security appropriations. Staff shortages further complicate the situation. Meanwhile, your bills are mounting and foreclosure may loom.</p>

<p>Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, who is one of the members of the Health Subcommittee, as well as the House Ways and Means Committee and chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee, agrees that the SSD status quo is "unacceptable."</p>

<p>As chairman, he presided over 18 hearings regarding the disability benefits program. He also requested that the President nominate a Social Security Commissioner. But the position remains unfilled.</p>

<p>Making it worst of all is that often applicants are denied on their first hearing and then have to appeal. That's another wait.</p>

<p>None of this is news that applicants want to hear, yet it's important to face the reality of the situation. With much out of applicants' control, it's vital to be proactive wherever possible. That means working closely with your SSD attorney to collect all pertinent medical records and other substantiating documentation and adhering to all deadlines.</p>

<p>Those suffering from mental or psychological conditions may qualify for Social Security Disability payments. However, the very nature of the condition that qualifies you for financial assistance can be a barrier to your application being successfully approved by the Social Security Administration (SSA).</p>

<p>In order to qualify for these payments through either the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) programs, applicants must prove their condition(s) prevent their gainful employment. Proving a <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Physical-Mental-Impairments/Psychological-Disorders.shtml">mental or psychological impairment</a> can be harder for claimants than proving physical disabilities.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>There is also a stigma that still clings to those who suffer from mental health issues, which can isolate them from the very avenues of help to get their benefits. While the breadth and scope of this post is too limited to list each psychological or mental condition that qualifies applicants for disability payments, below are some common examples of qualifying conditions.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bipolar Disorder</li>
	<li>Autism</li>
	<li>Schizophrenia</li>
	<li>Depression</li>
	<li>Mental Retardation</li>
	<li>Anxiety</li>
</ul>

<p>Applicants have to substantiate that their mental conditions impair them to a degree that working is impossible. The condition must also be expected to continue for a year or more.</p>

<p>In the case of bipolar disorder, the condition itself can prevent sufferers from maintaining compliance with their treatment program, including taking their medications. As this condition cycles from extreme highs to dangerous lows, it's not always apparent that an applicant is in the throes of the disease during the assessment period by the SSA.</p>

<p>If you feel that your mental condition could potentially qualify you for benefits, it's worth your while to learn about your legal rights to seek benefits.</p>

<p>If you have recently filed for disability benefits with the Social Security Administration (SSA) and they were denied, it's safe to say that you are disappointed, frustrated and confused. There are quite a few reasons why your benefits claim might have been denied. Today, we will take a look at those reasons.</p>

<p>A common reason why claims are denied is because the person's disability is based on the consumption of alcohol or drugs. The SSA will approve claims for those who suffer from mental or emotional issues that stem from prior alcohol or drug abuse. The SSA will not approve claims if it deems that simply removing the alcohol or drugs from your routine would mean you would no longer be disabled.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>There's also a possibility that you make too much money, which is why your claim was denied by the SSA. The SSA sets a limit, known as the substantial gain activity level, that prevents certain people from acquiring benefits due to their income. If you hit this level you will not be deemed disabled to the extent that you require financial assistance.</p>

<p>The SSA will look into each claim to determine if the claimant followed the orders issued by their doctor. If you strayed from the doctor's orders your claim will likely be denied.</p>

<p>If your disability is associated with criminal activity in any way, your claim will be denied by the SSA.</p>

<p>If you recently had a disability benefits claim denied by the SSA it's best to speak with an experienced <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Supplemental-Security-Income-SSI.shtml">supplemental security income attorney</a> about your claim in Indianapolis.</p>

<p>Are you going to miss work due to an injury or illness suffered on the job? This can cause you quite a bit of stress, no matter how long you will be out of work. When you file a disability claim with the Social Security Administration (SSA) you should know what to expect. You don't want to run into any surprises.</p>

<p>You first must have your illness or injury properly diagnosed by a medical professional. This is vital to the claims process, as not having documentation will prevent you from moving any further with the possible claim. You must also make sure that the evidence provided by the doctor is done so correctly or else it could hurt your claim in the end.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>When you decide to file the claim you can do so in one of two ways: in-person at your local Social Security office or online via the agency's website. It's best that you have a lawyer in mind when filing the claim in the event that you have any questions.</p>

<p>Once you file the claim, you will be scheduled for an interview with the agency. After the interview, the agency will then review your file, your application and any other information it has acquired about you. This is a waiting game for you and it can be a lengthy one. This could take up to six months to complete.</p>

<p>If your claim is denied you have the right to appeal the decision. This is best done with the help of an attorney. This can also be a lengthy process as the appeals process could go all the way to the federal appeals courts.</p>

<p>Are you preparing to file a disability claim with the SSA? If so, speaking with an experienced <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/">Social Security Disability </a>attorney will help you understand your rights and what it is you can expect when you file a claim in Indianapolis.</p>

<p>If you wish to acquire Social Security Disability from the Social Security Administration, you will need to properly prove that you are disabled and cannot work. Whether you are dealing with a short-term or permanent disability, the way you go about proving your disability makes all the difference. So, how do you prove that you are disabled?</p>

<p>The SSA handles claims for disability benefits very seriously. You need to know how to file for the claim and how to describe your disability. You also need to ensure that the disability is recognized by the SSA so that the claim is not denied.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The SSA views disability as something that prevents a person from performing the work one used to perform, prevents a person from performing another type of work, and it will last at least one year or will result in your death. Should you meet this condition, you will not be able to take part in any gainful employment. Should your monthly income go above a certain threshold, you will risk being labeled able to work by the SSA.</p>

<p>You must gather all of your medical history when proving disability. This includes history from prior to the disability and history after the disability. This history should include test results, examination records and more.</p>

<p>Have your doctor provide the SSA with evaluations of your condition. You should also seek medical opinions from specialists regarding your disability. This can go a long way towards proving your disability.</p>

<p>Filing for SSD with the SSA can be a daunting task. It might be a good idea to use the help of an experienced <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Working-With-Your-Doctor/">Indianapolis Social Security attorney</a> who can advise you of your rights and the best way to prove your disability.</p>

<p>When it comes to Social Security benefits, a disabled person must meet a special set of guidelines in order to qualify. This is because Social Security benefits are designed for those who cannot work to the same extent that they would have been able to if they were completely well.</p>

<p>Therefore, as a disabled person that is looking into the possibility of Social Security benefits, you should make sure that you understand the criteria that is in place before considering applying. It is important to pay particular attention to how the Social Security Administration (SSA) define the word "disabled".</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>How does the SSA define "disabled"?</strong></p>

<p>Although you might identify as a disabled person, this does not necessarily mean that you will be eligible for disability benefits under the SSA. The SSA give three main criteria that a person must fulfill if he or she is to qualify for disability benefits.</p>

<p>These are the fact that your disability has lasted over 12 months to date, as a continuous condition, or that your condition is terminal and cannot be cured. You must also be able to prove that as a result of this condition, you cannot work in the same job or career that you had previously, and that you are unable to do any work because of your condition.</p>

<p>When you can prove that you fulfill these three criteria, you can make an application to the SSA. They will then make a determination by investigating your lifestyle and the specifics of your condition.</p>

<p>If you are <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/">struggling to get the disability benefits that you deserve</a>, it is important to research the procedures fully so that you know how to make a successful application.</p>

<p>Social Security Disability Insurance has a great deal of myths surrounding it, and often this means that people become discouraged from applying in the first place. It's common for people to hear about all of the application denials that take place. However this should not discourage you from making an application, especially if you believe that you are eligible.</p>

<p>If you are denied for the first time, this does not mean that there is no hope for you. Many people make appeals and then become successful. The following are some of the most common myths about Social Security Disability Insurance, debunked.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Getting Social Security Disability Insurance will prevent me from ever getting a job</strong></p>

<p>Many people are worried about claiming for Social Security Disability Insurance because they believe that once they start getting the payments, they will lose any chance to become financially independent. However, this is not true, and there are several programs that can support people in getting part-time work while receiving the benefits.</p>

<p><strong>If my doctor can prove I'm disabled, I'll get approved</strong></p>

<p>Just because your doctor acknowledges that you have a disability, it does not mean that you will be automatically eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance. Many people with disabilities are able to work full-time with no problem. The benefits are there for those who are unable to work because of their condition.</p>

<p><strong>There's no reason to even try</strong></p>

<p>It's important to never be discouraged from applying, even if you believe that the chances of success are slim.

<p>When you are suffering from a long-term illness or disability, you may be in a position where you are finding it difficult to work full-time, and therefore, struggle to keep on top of bills and daily living expenses. It is for this reason that Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) exists. It is set up to make it possible for those who are disabled to have a good quality of life, and to help support them in getting back into the workplace, if this is possible.</p>

<p>Although SSDI is a great benefit that offers a lifeline for those in need, it can be a difficult and overwhelming process, and it is not uncommon for applicants to be denied at their first attempt.</p>

EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>How can I make sure that I get my application right the first time?</strong></p>

<p>It is important to prepare and take your time if you want to have a successful first-time application. Try to gather as many medical records as you can in order to support your case. You might have to wait for these to be sent to you by your hospital or doctor; therefore, it is a good idea to plan ahead of time.</p>

<p><strong>What should I do if I get denied?</strong></p>

<p>If you do get denied after your first application, there is no need to panic. However you should make sure that you either amend your application or request an appeal within two months.</p>

<p>It is an unfortunate fact that over 70 percent of all Social Security Disability (SSD) claims are denied. Although it is assumed that all of the people making the applications consider themselves to be disabled and struggling to work at full capacity, they for one reason or another were not considered eligible for SSD as their application stands.</p>

<p>This does not mean that their SSD claim will never be accepted. More often than not, the reason why a person has his or her claim denied is because of an administration error that can be fixed. The following are some of the most common reasons why SSD claims are denied.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>You are not following the doctor's recommended treatment</strong></p>

<p>If your doctor has found a treatment that they believe will help improve your condition, you may have a possibility to live your life as a nondisabled person again. However, if you refuse to take this line of treatment, you will not be eligible for disability benefits unless you can provide a good reason why you cannot accept this treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Your disability was caused by drug or alcohol abuse</strong></p>

<p>If the Social Security Administration (SSA) believes that your condition was caused primarily by the abuse of drugs or alcohol, then you will not be entitled to SSD. Causation is very difficult to prove, so you may want to dispute this.</p>

<p>If you are <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">struggling to successfully claim SSD benefits</a>, then it is important to identify the reason why before questioning what can be done about it. You may then want to consider an appeal.</p>

<p>When you are suffering from a mental illness such as depression or anxiety, the symptoms can become debilitating, and they may make it impossible for you to be able to carry out any type of meaningful work.</p>

<p>With the help of your medical provider, you may be able to successfully file a claim for disability benefits under the Social Security Administration (SSA) in regard to your mental illness. However, it is not always easy to successfully file a claim, no matter what your disability is. It is important that <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">you understand how mental illnesses are assessed</a> under the SSA and what information you will need to provide before you go about making your application.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Will my mental health issues be classified as a disability under the SSA?</p>

<p>There are two primary disability benefit programs that can be applied for under the SSA. These are Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). When it comes to SSI, a person will only qualify if he or she has almost no income at all. This is because the program is based on individual need, and they try to help those who are unable to earn money because of their debilitating illness.</p>

<p>SSDI is another type of benefit program that is available to those who have been working in previous years and paying Social Security taxes. If their disability has made it difficult for them to earn a significant income, they may by entitled to SSDI benefits.</p>

<p>If you are suffering from a mental illness, it is important to take action so that you can get the benefits that you deserve in Indiana.</p>

<p>When you have just acquired a disability or your condition has worsened to the point that you are unable to work anymore, it is important that you conduct research to find out if you are eligible for disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA).</p>

<p>If you wish to make an initial claim for disability benefits, you can do so through your local Indianapolis SSA network. You can make an application for disability in several ways: by applying on the telephone, online, through the mail or in person. Many applications are not successful after the first application, and the SSA's Office of Disability Adjudication and Review is responsible for managing all appeals through a Disability Determination Service.</p>

<p><strong>What are the responsibilities of my local Indianapolis SSA field office?</strong></p>

<p>All local SSA field offices have the responsibility to verify information and answer general questions that applicants or potential applicants might have. These might be questions about requirements that do not relate to medical issues, such as age and income.</p>

<p><strong>What is the Disability Determination Service responsible for?</strong></p>

<p>The Disability Determination Service has the responsibility to investigate and develop medical evidence that support cases. They must determine whether a person with a certain condition is eligible for disability benefits under the SSA. They do this by taking evidence from the claimant's own application, and then supplementing this information with consultative examinations.</p>

<p>If you are struggling to make a successful disability benefits claim under the SSA, it is important that you conduct thorough research on the <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/">application criteria</a>, as well as understanding what information you should provide.

<p>Fibromyalgia is an invisible condition, which can be difficult for people to cope with. This is because a person might look perfectly healthy, but in reality they are suffering and enduring through a great deal of pain. This could mean that acquaintances of the sufferer, including their employer, may lack understanding and empathy for what they are going through with their disability.</p>

<p>The symptoms of fibromyalgia include extreme pain, which can flare up when walking, putting pressure on the feet or moving any muscles. As a result, sufferers can be in a position where they are no longer able to pursue meaningful work, especially if the only type of work they are qualified for involves being active and on their feet.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Could I be eligible for social security disability benefits as a sufferer of fibromyalgia?</strong></p>

<p>The extent of and the severity of fibromyalgia will determine whether a sufferer will be eligible for disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA). In the SSA guidelines, a severe impairment must be recognized and determined by medical practitioners. It must also be proven that the patient has been suffering from pain for a minimum of three months, with a minimum of 11 out of 18 tender point sites being acknowledged as painful areas.</p>

<p>It must also be shown that the applicant is physically unable to continue in any work that they were participating in previous to their fibromyalgia diagnosis. Each applicant will also be assessed in accordance with the age group that they fall into.</p>

<p>If you are a <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/" >sufferer of fibromyalgia</a> and find yourself unable to continue work, it is important that you consider your eligibility for SSA benefits.</p>

<p>If you have a child who is on the autism spectrum, it is likely that you are in need of additional services and support to help give your child the best possible start in life. Therefore, you might be struggling with a financial burden that you wouldn't have had otherwise.</p>

<p>If this is the case, it might be possible that your child will qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSI is a needs-based support service; therefore, it is most likely that your family will be eligible if you have a low income. If you qualify for Medicaid or food stamps, then it is possible that you will also qualify for SSI.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Can my child qualify for SSI benefits even though he or she is under the age of 18?</strong></p>

<p>A child with autism or another type of disability can qualify for SSI from birth to the age of 18 based on factors such as the family income and the severity of his or her disabilities.</p>

<p><strong>My teenage autistic child is not eligible for SSI because our family earns too much. What will happen when he or she becomes an adult and need to support him or herself?</strong></p>

<p>In all cases, regardless of whether a child is eligible for SSI or not, his or her case will be reassessed at age 18. After the age of 18, the family income is not taken into account, as he or she is from that point considered an adult.</p>

<p>If you are struggling to successfully claim <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Supplemental-Security-Income-SSI.shtml">SSI for your autistic child</a>, it is important that you understand all of the eligibility criteria as well as the way disabilities are assessed.</p>

<p>If you are unable to work due to a disabling medical condition, you know you may have a rightful claim to certain benefits. However, disability benefits are not easy to secure and many people find that their first claim comes back denied. If you believe you have a claim to these benefits, it can be helpful to learn more about how the process works.</p>
<p>As part of the disability claims process, you will have to complete paperwork and include <a href="http://socialsecurity.findlaw.com/social-security-disability/how-to-prove-disability.html" target="_blank">evidence of your disabling condition</a>. Proving your disability can be complicated, and even with a significant amount of documentation included, your initial claim may not be successful. Many Indiana applicants find it helpful to seek guidance as they pursue the benefits they need.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>How can you prove your disability?</strong></p>
<p>As part of your disability claim, you will have to include documentation proving you have a serious physical or mental condition that prevents you from working. Not everyone with a serious illness will qualify for disability benefits, and your documentation must line up with the Social Security Administration's rather strict definition of disability. Your claim must clearly prove the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are not able to continue with the same work you did before your disability.</li>
<li>Your disability prevents you from working in other types of employment.</li>
<li>Your medical condition will last for a period of at least one year or ultimately result in your death.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many first time applications for disability benefits come back denied because of insufficient medical information included in the application. As you prepare your application, it is smart to gather as much documentation as possible, including notes from your doctor and more. The SSA needs to see documentation of the onset of your disabling condition.</p>
<p>Preparing your claim is an important step in the process of obtaining the benefits you need. As you work to prove you meet the definition of disability, you may find it helpful to seek experienced guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Your future is on the line</strong></p>
<p>When you are applying for disability benefits, there is a lot at stake. <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Benefits/">You need financial support</a> for your family and yourself, and any setbacks or delays can be frustrating and stressful. There is a lot on the line, but you do not have to walk through the claims process alone. You may find it helpful to seek an understanding of your rights and how you can build a strong claim before you even begin the process.</p>

<p>Being diagnosed with periodic paralysis can be devastating, and as a sufferer, one of your greatest concerns might be based around keeping your financial independence and being able to support yourself as well as any dependents you have.</p>

<p>As a sufferer of periodic paralysis, it is important to know about the support that may be available to you. You will likely be eligible for state support if you can prove that your condition is preventing you from being physically able to earn an income.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>What benefit options are available to me?</strong></p>

<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has two main types of benefits available for disabled people who are unable to earn a significant income due to their disability.</p>

<p>The first of these benefits is known as Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). This is available to those who have previously been working and have paid Social Security taxes in the past. In order to claim these, you must have been working for at least five of the 10 past years.</p>

<p>The other is available to those who have not paid enough Social Security taxes to qualify for SSDI. This is called Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and it is available to disabled people at any age, whether they are children or elderly. It is based purely of the needs of the applicant; therefore, you must be able to prove that you have a valid disability and a low income.</p>

<p>If you are a <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Supplemental-Security-Income-SSI.shtml">sufferer of periodic paralysis</a>, it is important that you take action as soon as possible to file for the benefits that you deserve.</p>

<p>If you are a person that is suffering from a disability, it can be very disheartening when you are not able to get by financially, and when you are not able to work. When you are in this position, you might be unsure about what state benefits you are entitled to, and whether the specific impairment or disability that you are suffering from will enable you to claim benefits.</p>

<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is the department that is responsible for the regulations and claims surrounding disability benefits. They publish something that is informally known as the blue book, officially named as the "Listing of Medical Impairments". This book lists every type of disability or illness that can make a person eligible for disability benefits.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>What are impairments that are approved by the SSA?</strong></p>

<p>You must read the Listing of Medical Impairments if you want to learn about the full breakdown of all impairments, and this is usually best done by a medical professional, since the language can be quite technical.</p>

<p>However, in general, the impairment list is broken down and categorized by bodily function. These categories include digestive tract issues, senses and speech impairments, back conditions and other musculoskeletal problems, heart issues and blood related diseases and various different neurological disorders.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about the benefits that you are entitled to because of the impairment that you have, it is important to conduct extensive research. <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">Applying for disability benefits</a> is a very lengthy and complex process, so consulting with your doctor is wise, since he or she can give you guidance and advice.</p>

<p>When applying for Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits as a disabled person or on behalf of a disabled person, it is important that you first find out whether the specific disability is listed as eligible under the Social Security Administration (SSA). This is especially true for mental disorders.</p>

<p>The condition, if recognized by the SSA, should also be officially diagnosed by a doctor before you can apply. It also must satisfy many other rules and regulations if you are to be successful in your disability benefits application.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>What categories of mental illness are recognized?</strong></p>

<p>A broad range of mental illnesses are within the criteria. These include psychotic disorders, affective disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders and learning disorders.</p>

<p><strong>How severe does the mental disorder need to be in order to qualify?</strong></p>

<p>Disability benefits are primarily in place in order to offer support to those who cannot work due to their conditions. Therefore, in order to qualify, your mental disorder must be severe enough to be preventing you from being able to do the work that you were doing previously.</p>

<p>It must also be stopping you from being able to train for other types of work, or prevent you from gaining any other type of reasonable work. It also needs to be a long-term condition, that has either existed for at least a year, or is expected to last for more than a year in the future.</p>

<p>If you or a loved one is <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">suffering a mental disorder</a>, it is important to speak to your doctor, and they can often suggest the best way to move forward.</p>

BODY:


<p>If you believe that you are eligible for disability benefits, it is important to take your time to fully research and prepare before making your application with the Social Security Administration (SSA). Only around 30 percent of applications are accepted each year, and this is most often because the applicants did not provide sufficient information to be successful.</p>

<p>As part of your preparation, it is a good idea to speak with your doctor so that he or she can give you medical insight and the professional guidance that you are likely to need. Many of the guidelines that the SSA has put in place are complex and are better looked over by a medical expert.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>What information or documentation will my doctor be able to provide?</strong></p>

<p>Your doctor will know your medical condition and the extent of your disability from a medical standpoint. They will, therefore, be able to produce a written statement to be submitted as part of your Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits application. They must also provide evidence of your condition, such as medical exams, lab test results or X-ray scans. This will help the SSA to form an objective view of your condition.</p>

<p>Your doctor, in his or her statements, must also acknowledge that your condition is severe enough to prevent you from being able to contribute gainful work activity, and therefore, that you should gain disability benefits. If you are concerned about <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Working-With-Your-Doctor/">successfully gaining disability benefits</a>, you should make sure to thoroughly research the requirements and ensure that you provide all of the necessary information before making your application.</p>

<p>It is a significant problem when a person is unable to work due to a disabling mental or physical condition. As an Indiana adult, this has a direct effect on a person's ability to provide for himself or herself, live independently and provide for his or her family. Fortunately, disabled individuals have the option to seek financial support through one of the two programs offered by the Social Security Administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://socialsecurity.findlaw.com/social-security-disability/what-is-the-difference-between-ssdi-and-ssi-.html" target="_blank">distinct differences</a>&nbsp;between Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance, and they serve two different groups of people. Before you apply, it is beneficial to learn about these differences and understand your best option before you move forward with a claim.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Understanding SSI and SSDI</strong></p>
<p>The most significant difference between these two programs are the eligibility requirements. Basically, if you worked for a certain amount of time and paid into the Social Security system, you could be eligible for SSDI benefits. If you did not, you will have to apply for SSI. Potential applicants may find it beneficial to remember the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SSDI: </strong>In order to be eligible, you must have a certain work history that qualifies you for benefits. You must also have a disability expected to last for a period of at least one year. The amount of benefits you could receive depend on how much you work and how much you paid into the system</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>SSI: </strong>Money from these benefits comes from tax revenue. Even without a certain work history or taxable income, you could still be eligible for SSI. In order to qualify for SSI, you cannot have more than a specific amount of money or assets valued over a specific amount.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the basic eligibility requirements for both of the types of benefits you can apply for. The application process for each is complex, and it is likely your initial claim will come back denied. It is beneficial to seek guidance and support for the entire claims process.</p>
<p><strong>Fighting for the type of support you deserve</strong></p>
<p>Securing disability benefits is not an easy task. The claims process is fraught with complications, and many people find themselves frustrated to learn that their claim came back denied. You do not have to walk through this process alone, but you can seek the <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Benefits/">support needed </a>to complete the application, deal with any appeals and confront any other challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might find it helpful to seek a complete evaluation of your case, including an explanation of the differences between SSDI and SSI before you apply.</p>

<p>Fibromyalgia can be so detrimental to your health that it is impossible for you to work any longer. However, one of the big problems with this disorder is that many people do not understand it completely. This even extends to medical professionals, as this disorder is often misdiagnosed.</p>

<p>Since a proper medical diagnosis is needed when seeking Social Security disability benefits, it is important to know what signs and symptoms to watch out for. Below are a few of the most common:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An often overwhelming sense of fatigue</li>
	<li>Widespread pain in your joints and your muscles</li>
	<li>Tender points on your body</li>
	<li>Problems sleeping, which could contribute to fatigue</li>
	<li>The onset of depression</li>
	<li>Constant anxiety</li>
	<li>A general sense of stiffness in muscles and joints every morning</li>
	<li>Memory problems and issues concentrating, which are often called the "fibro fog"</li>
	<li>Consistent headaches</li>
	<li>A tingling feeling in your legs, arms and hands</li>
	<li>Numbness, often in the extremities</li>
	<li>Issues urinating</li>
	<li>Irritable bowel syndrome</li>
	<li>Menstrual cramps that are more painful than usual</li>
</ul>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Understanding these symptoms is critical because it is often all that doctors have to go on. They do not have any imaging tests they can use to <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">detect fibromyalgia</a>. There are no lab tests they can perform. The diagnosis is based on meeting with your doctor, talking over your symptoms and determining whether or not they mean you have the disorder.</p>

<p>If you do, it can certainly keep you out of work and seriously impact you and your family financially. It is important to know if you have a right to Social Security disability benefits and what steps you'll need to take to apply for them.</p>

<p>Depression is an illness that is just as pervasive and debilitating as any physical disease. However, it can be more difficult to recognize as a problem and more difficult to diagnose. Depression may have crept up on you over time, and you found yourself being less able to do the things that you normally took for granted.</p>

<p>If you are unable to work because of the depression that you are suffering from, there may be ways for you to get financial benefits from the government. It is first important that you make sure you have fulfilled the eligibility criteria before making a claim.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Make sure that your depression has been diagnosed</strong></p>

<p>In order for you to claim benefits for suffering from depression, you need to first be diagnosed with depression. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is defined as a condition where a person has sleeping issues, feelings of self-hate and worthlessness, suicidal thoughts and an inability to process thoughts clearly. If you have these symptoms, you should speak to your doctor and explain how these symptoms are affecting you.</p>

<p><strong>Follow doctor's orders</strong></p>

<p>You will only be eligible for governmental disability benefits if you are taking the medication prescribed by your doctor. Therefore, if you have been prescribed antidepressants by your doctor but are refusing to take them, you will not be eligible for benefits.</p>

<p>If you are suffering from symptoms of depression and cannot work as a result, it is important that you seek medical attention as soon as possible and <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/">consider how disability benefits could help you</a> from a financial perspective.</p>

<p>If you're suffering from a medical condition listed in what's colloquially known as the Social Security Administration's (SSA) "blue book," there's a strong likelihood that you may qualify to receive disability benefits.</p>

<p>In order to be automatically qualified to receive either Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), your condition must be included in the SSA's "Listing of Medical Impairments."</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Adults with respiratory illnesses that include cystic fibrosis and severe asthma are generally eligible to receive SSDI or SSI. So, too, are those with blood disorders like hemophilia or sickle cell disease.</p>

<p>Any adult with the documented cardiovascular conditions of coronary artery disease or chronic heart failure is automatically eligible to receive SSDI also. Those with compromised immune systems, whether it stems from lupus, kidney disease, HIV/AIDS or rheumatoid arthritis can receive SSI benefits as well.</p>

<p>Individuals who suffer from chronic digestive problems such as inflammatory bowel syndrome, liver disease or musculoskeletal problems also qualify. Those afflicted with neurological disorders, e.g., epilepsy and multiple sclerosis, or mental health conditions like autism or depression may quality for either SSDI or SSI also.</p>

<p>Those with hearing or vision loss or problems with their speech automatically qualify to receive these benefits under existing guidelines.</p>

<p>Even if your condition doesn't fall on this list, you may still be eligible to receive either SSI or SSDI. Whether you're suffering from that condition or one from the list, your ability to receive benefits is contingent upon your completion of a physical exam, outcome of tests that have been performed on you and a thorough review of your medical records and blood panels.</p>

<p>If you believe that you may <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Supplemental-Security-Income-SSI.shtml">qualify for disability benefits</a>, an Indianapolis Supplemental Security Income attorney can guide you through the process involved.</p>

EXTENDED BODY:
<p>You're shocked. What you may have wanted to consider before you applied is that the odds were not in your favor. Reports show that around two-thirds of applications in the United States wind up getting denied every year.</p>

<p>But you are sure that your case should qualify. How could you have gotten denied anyway?</p>

<p>Often, a technical error is the true reason for the denial. These can be very simple. For instance, you may have simply missed some critical information on your application. Maybe you omitted your birthday or accidentally used your maiden name. Or, perhaps you did not provide enough documentation, such as medical records and work records.</p>

<p>That does not always mean you can't get the benefits. You may qualify. You just have to rectify the errors first. This is especially true in cases where you do not provide enough information. Those medical records exist. You just have to get them to send in and prove you deserve the benefits.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what to do after a denial, you may be able to <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/">appeal</a>. Make sure you know all of the proper steps to take.</p>

<p>If your disability means you face many struggles in your daily life, it should be no surprise to you that trying to obtain Social Security Disability Insurance benefits will be one more struggle. Close to a million people apply for SSDI each year, and only about a third of those applicants gain approval for financial assistance.</p>
<p>This statistic may seem daunting and even discouraging to you. However, if you understand some of the reasons why the Social Security Administration <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/Denied-Claims.shtml">denies so many claims</a>, you may be better able to prepare an application that will improve your chances of receiving the benefits you need and deserve.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Common reasons for SSDI denials</strong></p>
<p>Assuming your illness, injury or condition is one that the SSA accepts as a disabling condition, your application and documentation play a major role in the decision to accept or deny your claim for benefits. The more thorough and accurate your application, the more evidence you are providing of how much your condition affects your daily life and your ability to earn money. Errors in your application, insufficient medical documentation and fraudulent applications are <a href="https://socialsecurity.findlaw.com/social-security-disability/why-a-disability-claim-gets-denied.html" target="_blank">some of the reasons</a> why the SSA may deny your claim.</p>
<p>Other common reasons why your application may be at risk of rejection include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are earning money that places your income above the eligibility limit.</li>
<li>Doctors do not expect your disability to last at least one year.</li>
<li>You are attempting to claim disability for an injury suffered during the commission of a felony or while imprisoned for a felony conviction.</li>
<li>You failed to cooperate with the SSA, or the SSA was unable to reach you for follow-up information.</li>
<li>You are claiming a disability for a condition that exists because of your ongoing abuse of alcohol or drugs.</li>
<li>You willingly failed to follow medical advice prescribed for your condition, such as taking medications or going to therapy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SSA may also reject your claim if you fail to provide adequate documentation, including records of all visits to doctors, specialists, emergency clinics and therapists related to your disability. You must also include proof of all treatments and medications you have used to treat your condition and every attempt you made to find relief for the disabling symptoms.</p>
<p>While this may be simpler to document for physical ailments, you may find it challenging to know what to include if you suffer from a mental illness or a condition that is not as obvious to diagnose, such as chronic fatigue syndrome. For assistance in completing your application for the best opportunity of avoiding a denial, an Indiana legal professional is a good advocate. You can also seek legal help for appealing an SSDI denial.</p>

<p>Age discrimination doesn't exist when it comes to disabilities. Whether you are young or old, you may find yourself disabled and unable to work due to a variety of physical and mental conditions. In fact, one out of every five Americans suffers from a disability and many of them probably live right here in Indiana. That's 56 million people nationwide.</p>
<p>If you and three of your friends are currently in your 20s, one of you will suffer from a disability before you reach retirement age. Where can you turn for financial assistance if that one person is you? You may qualify for Social Security disability insurance benefits.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Does your condition qualify for </strong><strong>SSDI</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>As you can imagine, the Social Security Administration doesn't just provide SSDI benefits to everyone. At a minimum, you will need to meet these&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10570.pdf" target="_blank">strict criteria</a> in order to qualify:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a serious medical condition that has kept you out of work for a year already or will keep you out of work for at least a year.</li>
<li>Due to your condition, you can no longer do the work you did prior to your disability.</li>
<li>Due to your condition, you are unable to find other gainful employment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of people qualifying for SSDI benefits has continued to rise over the 60 years the program has existed. This is mainly due to the aging of the baby boomer generation and the increase of women in the workforce who qualify for benefits over the last few decades.</p>
<p><strong>If the </strong><strong>SSA</strong><strong> knew more people would need benefits, why are so many denied?</strong></p>
<p>The SSA designed the application process to help weed out people who would take advantage of the system by committing fraud. This often results in people who should receive benefits <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">receiving a denial of their initial applications</a>. Not only must you have paid into the Social Security system, but you must also make it through the strict screening process regarding your disability.</p>
<p>The amount of benefits you may receive is set by the SSA, the trick is whether the agency believes you are disabled and in need of benefits. This is where an experienced SSDI attorney may prove invaluable. Most claims may be denied, but you may request a reconsideration and file appeals if necessary. You have more than one chance to prove your case, and putting your best foot forward could help that happen faster.</p>

<p>When you are in great need of disability benefits, it can be heartbreaking when you have your application rejected. It is very common to have your application rejected the first time you apply, and often the reason is due to a minor mistake that you made in the application that you submitted, or due to a failure in providing enough information.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you have experienced a denial of Social Security benefits or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), it is important that you do not lose hope. Being proactive in learning what went wrong in your application is often the key to completing a successful application the second time around.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Establishing the reason for your application denial</strong></p>

<p>Your application could have been denied for a variety of reasons, but this reason should have been explained to you in your decision letter.

Your application may have been denied for medical reasons. For example, they may argue that your disability is not recognized as you describe it, in which case you may have grounds to make an appeal. Alternatively, you may have missed out some information that the Social Security Administration (SSA) needs in order to make a decision. Your application may also be denied due to a nonmedical reason, for example your income or living arrangements. In this case, you should review your application and make sure that all information is correct.</p>

<p>If you are <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/">struggling to successfully apply for Social Security benefits</a>, it is a good idea to continue your research in how your circumstances can be catered for in Indiana.</p>

BODY:


<p>If you are a recipient of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or you are working on your SSI application, there may be a way for you to receive the payments earlier than usual. The Social Security Administration (SSA) understands that some people are struggling financially as a result of their disability, and therefore, in some situations, they make it possible to receive early payments in a number of ways.</p>

<p>In order to gain an early payment for your SSI application, you should make sure to understand how this can be done and work out which one would be applicable to you.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>What are the different ways that expedited payments can be received?</strong></p>

<p>One of the most common ways that people can receive early payments of their SSI benefits is by successfully being granted presumptive blindness or disability payments. Since the Disability Determination Service (DDS) can take six months to reach a decision on your application, it is possible for you to receive those payments based on the fact that you have a very high chance of having your application approved.</p>

<p>You may also be able to receive an emergency advance payment if you can show that you are facing a financial emergency. This is to be used in extreme circumstances when you cannot afford basics such as food and shelter.</p>

<p>If you are in an <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Supplemental-Security-Income-SSI.shtml">urgent need of SSI benefits</a>, it is possible to do if you can prove that you are eligible beyond reasonable doubt. Make sure to do thorough research and apply it to your individual situation before seeking the benefits from the SSA.</p>

<p>Filing for Social Security Disability benefits can be a daunting and stressful task for anyone. Even if you've done it in the past, having to file can still bring confusion and the fear that the claim will be denied by the Social Security Administration (SSA). Here are some tips for getting your doctor involved when filing for benefits so you can ensure that the claim is accepted the first time you file in Indianapolis.</p>

<p>The first thing you doctor will need to do in helping you apply for benefits is provide the SSA with a written statement. This statement will explain the disability you have, its extent, and the overall circumstances surrounding the disability. The statement should be accompanied by your medical records related to the disability.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>It's best to notify your doctors ahead of time that you will be applying for benefits from the SSA. This will give them plenty of time to prepare the written statement and secure the required documents from your medical history.</p>

<p>In the written statement your doctor will need to also explain, in depth, why your disability prevents you from securing employment. This explanation should be related to your previous employment and any future employment you might seek.</p>

<p>If your claim has been denied by the SSA, you are eligible to appeal. This will also involve your doctor. He or she will need to provide the SSA with another statement of your condition. Make sure he or she submits it prior to your appeal hearing.</p>

<p>If you need to file for SSD and aren't sure where to begin it's best to consult with your family physician. He or she will be able to answer your questions and guide you through the process of <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Working-With-Your-Doctor/">applying for disability in Indiana</a>.</p>

<p>Cancer is a disease that can require debilitating treatments, some of which may rob you of your quality of life, including your ability to work. In addition to your medical condition, the inability to work can have a significant negative impact on your life. Your situation may be overwhelming, but you have options. As a person with a disabling medical condition, you may be able to get certain benefits through the Social Security Administration.</p>
<p>Applying for benefits is not always easy, and you may find there are many roadblocks standing between you and the financial support you need.

EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>How do you know if you qualify?</strong></p>
<p>In order for an Indiana applicant to qualify for disability benefits, you must have evidence that you are unable to work because of a medical condition or physical injury. You must be able to provide evidence of your medical needs, as well as other requirements. It can be helpful to know the following about how the disability process works:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have a work history that includes paying into the Social Security system.</li>
<li>Your application must contain clear and substantial evidence of a medical condition that meets the SSA's definition of disability.</li>
<li>If you do not have a qualifying work history, you may be able to obtain other types of benefits through Supplemental Security Income.</li>
<li>The amount of benefits you may be able to receive depends on how long you worked and how much Social Security tax you paid while you worked.</li>
</ul>
<p>The disability benefits process is complex. It can be frustrating and confusing, but you do not have to walk through it alone. Many applicants find it beneficial to seek guidance as they complete the application and deal with any setbacks that may arise.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with complications</strong></p>

<p>Back injuries are some of the most commonly suffered injuries in workplaces all across Indiana. You don't have to be working a physical job to suffer a back injury while at work. In fact, many injuries are preventable and even suffered by those who don't need to lift heavy items regularly. Today, we will look at some safety tips for preventing back injuries while on the job.</p>

<p>If you have a job that requires you to lift a lot of items, no matter their weight, you need to add an exercise routine to your life. Exercising on a daily basis, or at least three times per week, will strengthen your muscles and improve your ability to lift different weighted items. Exercise will help reduce the stress placed on your back, and your entire body, when lifting items regularly.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>You also need to lift items properly all the time. Do not bend at the waist or try to pick an item up using only your arms. You need to lift using the lower portion of your body. Make sure you bend your knees and tighten your core muscles before lifting anything at work.</p>

<p>Do your best to listen to your body. This might sound a little off the beaten path but it is important. Your body will tell you whether or not you can lift any items at work. If your muscles feel weak or stiff, you need to stretch before lifting.</p>

<p>As you can see, it's important to be mindful of how you <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">lift items at the workplace</a> and how you sit at your desk. Back injuries are preventable, but when they aren't you could be eligible for Social Security disability if you find yourself out of work for a prolonged period.</p>

<p>In order to qualify for Social Security disability, you need to prove that you have a disabling condition that will prevent you from working for at least a year or that you have a fatal condition. Proving that this is the case may not be entirely easy in all situations. In fact, many people apply for Social Security disability, get denied and have to resubmit with more complete information for another review.</p>

<p>In some cases, if you have a clear diagnosis of one of the Social Security Administration's pre-approved conditions, you can receive an automatic approval into the Social Security disability program. In other cases, if you don't have a pre-approved condition, you'll need to provide evidence and doctors notes explaining what your condition is, why it prevents you from doing your job and how long your disabled or fatal condition is likely to last.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Your doctor will play a vital role in your disability application no matter your situation, so it's important that you let your doctor know the reason why you want a diagnosis. Many doctors are aware of the types of requirements you'll need to satisfy for a disability determination, but if you're running into difficulty with the information provided by your doctor, you might want to speak to another one -- perhaps a doctor recommended by your disability attorney.</p>

<p>If your doctor can provide evidence that you're suffering from a pre-approved condition, this will excellent for your situation. No one will ever know for sure whether your <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Working-With-Your-Doctor/">Social Security disability claim</a> will succeed until after it goes through the process and gets approved or denied; however, if your doctor is willing to work with you to help show Social Security that you are, indeed, disabled, then you'll have a much better chance of achieving your goals.</p>

<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) provides important support to disabled Americans. Many of them wouldn't be able to live independent lives if it weren't for this vital financial aid. However, it isn't always easy getting approved for Social Security Disability (SSD). Countless applications are denied every year.</p>

<p>Fortunately, individuals who are initially denied SSD benefits may have have good luck pursuing an appeal. First, before filing such an appeal it's important to understand the how and why the initial application was denied. Here are some of the most common reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The applicant makes too much money. Those who earn over $940 monthly won't qualify for SSD benefits.</li>
	<li>The disability is not going to last 12 months or it isn't related to a fatal illness.</li>
	<li>The disabled person is not following the treatment plan of his or her doctor, and he or she doesn't qualify for the following exemptions from treatment:
	<ul>
		<li>You can't afford treatment</li>
		<li>The treatment is against your religion</li>
		<li>The doctor's prescribed treatment wasn't effective</li>
		<li>Your mental illness prevents you from following the treatment</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You didn't submit the medical records requested by the SSA.</li>
	<li>The SSA hasn't been able to find you.</li>
</ul>

EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Once you understand the reason for the denial of an SSD claim, you can then focus on gathering the necessary information to submit an appeal. In some cases, with better medical records that prove an illness and a clearer diagnosis from the doctor or more information, applicants can cure their <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/">Social Security claim deficiencies</a>, qualify for benefits and receive the financial support they desperately require.</p>

<p>The government has been steadily closing the number of Social Security offices around the country for over a decade, effectively shutting down nearly a tenth of its offices around the nation.</p>

<p>Lawmakers have given various reasons for the closings. They mention everything from the issues they've had with funding to the fact that many services provided by the agency (including many disability applications) are now available online.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>However, despite all the online services, <a href="https://www.fedweek.com/federal-managers-daily-report/house-members-seek-end-to-ssa-office-closures/" target="_blank">visits to field offices</a> have actually increased by five percent in two years. Claimants and recipients alike can't get the same level of expertise or real answers to complicated questions online. For that, they really need the expertise of a human claims representative.</p>

<p>In addition, the process of filing for disability benefits is confusing and convoluted, and the people who are in that situation simply can't afford to make a mistake. A mistake on an initial application for Social Security Disability benefits could cause a claim to be unfairly denied.</p>

<p>A denial often results in forcing the claimant to endure a long waiting period while the claim works its way through the system all over again. If the claim gets denied again, the disabled individual can literally wait years to get a hearing in front of the Administrative Law Judge.</p>

<p>In the offices that do remain open, wait times are getting longer. This puts an additional burden on the elderly and disabled. Many have to take public transportation to their local offices and then have to endure a long wait once they get there in a crowded office before they speak to someone. Then, if the office is closing or there's no one available with the skills to help them, they're forced to make an appointment or come back and try again.</p>

<p>The elderly and disabled don't deserve this kind of treatment. The only way to change the situation is to put increasing pressure on government officials through letters and calls to ask them to reverse course. Many representatives are already working toward that goal, but they need as much support as they can get.</p>

<p>In addition, it's important to take steps to minimize mistakes on <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">your application for disability benefits</a>. Any mistake is one too many,  and it could force you to endure unnecessary hardships.</p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating condition that can affect a person's ability to live his or her life to the fullest. The severity of MS can very from person to person however, and because of this, a full assessment must be made before applying for any Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits.</p>

<p>It is notoriously difficult to make a successful first-time application for disability benefits, and this is generally because of the accuracy of information required. Because of the high standard of accuracy needed for disability benefit applications, it is important that you work closely with your doctor during the application process.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>How is MS usually measured by a doctor?</strong></p>

<p>There are several <a href="https://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/disability-measured#1" target="_blank">different ways in which MS is measured</a> for the purposes of SSD applications. These are seen as tools for your doctor to be able to use in communicating the severity of your MS disability on your application.</p>

<p>The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is often alternatively named the Kurtzke scale. This assessment mainly focuses on physical mobility in regard to your illness, and therefore, assesses you mainly on your ability to walk. After a 30-minute assessment, a medical professional will be able to chart you from between zero and 10 on the EDSS scale.</p>

<p>The Functional System Score (FSS) is another type of assessment that looks at the functioning of your central nervous system. This creates a rating of between zero and 6 based on speech, bladder function and control of the body.</p>

<p>If you or a loved one is suffering from MS, it is important to <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Working-With-Your-Doctor/">work with a medical professional during the application process</a> for disability benefits.</p>

<p>After making your online application for SSI benefits, you do not need to take any further action. A Social Security representative will contact you in regard to your application after it has been reviewed.</p>

<p>When a medical condition negatively impacts your life, it can leave you with serious concerns about your financial security and your ability to work. Indiana readers understand that certain illnesses and disorders can seriously affect physical capabilities, leaving victims unable to hold gainful employment. Sometimes these disabling medical conditions do not show any outwards signs, yet they are serious and debilitating.</p>
<p>A medical condition that could impact your life with few, if any, outward symptoms is arthritis. This is a rather common condition, yet there are some cases <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/arthritis-disability#disability" target="_blank">severe enough to affect a person's ability</a>&nbsp;to work and do other everyday activities. If you have a serious case of this disease and find you can no longer work as you did in the past, you could be eligible for Social Security disability benefits.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Understanding the impact of arthritis</strong></p>
<p>Millions of Americans have arthritis, and it is actually one of the leading causes of disability in the country. For 10 percent of adults with arthritis, the effects are severe enough to hinder physical abilities. There are various types of arthritis, but all of them cause pain and complications related to inflammation. The impact of arthritis differs from person to person. Some of the most common characteristics of this illness include the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Severe pain in various areas of the body</li>
<li>Problems with breathing</li>
<li>Excessive fatigue and exhaustion</li>
</ul>
<p>A diagnosis of this specific medical condition will not necessarily qualify you for disability. Your eligibility for these financial benefits depends largely on how the condition affects your ability to walk, sit, stand and meet the physical demands of your job.</p>
<p>In order to have a valid claim to these benefits, you will have to submit a completed application, including sufficient medical documentation and more. Many applicants find the process confusing and complex, and it can be helpful to have guidance as you <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">walk through the required steps</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The help you need for the future you deserve</strong></p>
<p>It is not easy to secure disability benefits, even with a valid medical condition. Unfortunately, the process is difficult, and many initial claims are not successful. However, through reconsiderations and appeals, you can continue to fight for the outcome you deserve. You may find it beneficial to seek a complete evaluation of your case in order to understand how you can fight for the support you need. You are entitled to an explanation of your legal options.</p>

<p>When we are able-bodied, the prospect of becoming disabled in the future is never something that we seriously consider. However, disability is a very common thing and something that happens to many of us. In fact, research has estimated that 25 percent of people currently in their 20s will become disabled before the age of 67.</p>

<p>When you have been recently diagnosed with a disability, you may find it hard to come to terms with the fact that you may no longer be able to gain a full-time income. Lost income is something that affects many newly disabled people. This is why Social Security has measures in place to financially help disabled people in need.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>What are the types of financial aid for disabled people?</strong></p>

<p>There are two main types of Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits, and the right one for you depends on your past working experience. If you have worked extensively in the past and have paid your Social Security taxes during that time, you may be able to claim benefits from the SSD program. If you have not worked enough to claim this, then you can apply for the Supplemental Security Income (SSI),  which helps disabled adults and children based on need.</p>

<p><strong>How is disability determined?</strong></p>

<p>For both <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/disability/" target="_blank">Social Security</a> aid schemes, the disability criteria is the same. During the application process, your medical records will be assessed to determine whether you are eligible.</p>

<p>If you have recently become disabled and you would like to gain <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/">financial help in Indiana</a>, it is important to take action as soon as possible in order to get the best possible result.</p>

BODY:


<p>Many people suffer from injuries and diseases that prevent them from being able to work for a temporary period of time or permanently. This can be especially difficult, because on top of suffering from a debilitating condition, the person will also have the added burden of needing to worry about his or her financial situation.</p>

<p>This is why the government has programs in place to help people who are unable to work because of a disability. While many people might think that a disability means being unable to walk or being bedridden, it can in fact mean many things.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Disability can definitely be either physical or psychological. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a comprehensive list of recognized disabilities, and they also assess cases on a needs basis, recognizing that all conditions have the potential to vary greatly in severity.</p>

<p><strong>Anxiety disorders as disabilities</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/anxiety-disorders#1" target="_blank" >Anxiety disorders</a> are a group of related mental illnesses that can have the potential to debilitate a person and prevent him or her from living a normal and fulfilled life. Conditions that fall into the anxiety disorder spectrum include panic disorder, situational phobias, generalized anxiety disorders and social anxiety disorders.</p>

<p>Symptoms of these conditions usually include problems with sleep, an inability to feel calm, a constant or temporary sensation of intense panic and sensations of dizziness and nausea. When these symptoms are severe, they can prevent a person from being able to leave the house or undertake any form of meaningful work.</p>

<p>If you are <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/" >suffering from severe anxiety</a>, it is important to know that you may have the right to disability benefits in the state of Indiana.</p>

<p>If you have an illness or disability that means that you are unable to work as a result, it is likely that you now have the additional burden of wondering how you are going to make a living while you are struggling with your health.</p>

<p>When you are in a position such as this, it is important to know more about the benefits that are potentially available to you. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are both potential options for you to benefit from. However, in order to successfully qualify for programs such as these, you must first be able to show that you are in fact disabled, which is not as easy as it sounds.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Strict definitions of disability under the Social Security Administration (SSA)</strong></p>

<p>The SSA has a comprehensive <a href="https://socialsecurity.findlaw.com/social-security-disability/how-to-prove-disability.html" target="_blank">definition of disability</a>, and in order to benefit financially from their programs, you must show that you qualify. Your doctor and other medical professionals can play a fundamental role in assisting you in this pursuit, since they have the medical expertise required to assess your situation and make an adequate recommendation.</p>

<p>You firstly must show that your disability has made it so that you can no longer do the work that you used to be able to do. In addition, you must be able to show that you cannot do any other type of work. The disability in question cannot be temporary: It must last at least one year or be expected to result in death.</p>

<p>If you are struggling to qualify for disability benefits, it is vital that you <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Working-With-Your-Doctor/">work with your doctor</a> so that they can give you expert advice. A disability attorney can also provide the guidance you need when filing or appealing your claim. </p>

<p>An Indianapolis man has become the face of the wait for Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits in the community. The man has been featured in local media recently, shown panhandling to survive.</p>

<p>He said he has been forced to ask for help since it has been a year since he applied for disability – with no decision yet. He said he had heart surgery in April 2017, and in August of that year, <a href="https://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/indianapolis/indy-man-says-he-panhandles-because-he-s-forced-to-wait-almost-2-years-for-disability" target="_blank">he applied for disability</a>. He has no income and still doesn't know if he'll ever be approved by the Social Security Administration (SSA) for monthly disability payments.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>"You learn to survive out here," the man told The Indy Channel. "I got to do something … Got to live; got to eat."</p>

<p>According to SSA reports, there are 760,000 people across the country waiting to find out if they will receive disability pay.</p>

<p>The Indy Channel confirmed that the man applied for the federal benefits on August 8, 2017. But the station also learned by communicating with the SSA's Chicago office that the average wait time in Indianapolis for disability applicants is 19 months.</p>

<p>In that case, this man still has six months to wait. He is one of 8,800 Indiana residents on the list.</p>

<p>In 2017, an SSA spokesperson told The Indy Channel, "The Social Security disability program is an important resource for people with disabilities, and we work tirelessly every day to provide the best service possible. We acknowledge that current average processing times for disability appeal hearings are high nationally, around 560 days, and we are working to address the issue."</p>

<p>This man's medical condition very likely is one that qualifies him for SSD payments. Anyone facing a similar situation should contact an <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">Indiana attorney with experience in such cases</a> to make sure all proper procedures have been followed. With such a long wait, no one wants to find out their case has been thrown out based on a technicality.</p>

<p>Indiana readers understand the importance of disability benefits in the lives of men and women who are unable to work due to a medical condition, mental disability or serious injury. If you cannot work, you understand this is a serious strain for you and your family, and you may need benefits to help meet your daily needs. It can be both frustrating and overwhelming to find out your disability claim came back denied.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, denied disability claims are rather common, but <a href="https://socialsecurity.findlaw.com/social-security-disability/disability-reconsideration-appealing-a-denied-claim.html" target="_blank">you still have options</a>. This is not the end of the road for you. You have the right to continue your pursuit of disability benefits by requesting a reconsideration of your application. This can be a lengthy and frustrating process, but you do not have to walk through it alone.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Why do claims come back denied?</strong></p>
<p>There are many reasons why a Social Security Disability claim may come back denied. One of the most helpful steps of the reconsideration process is to determine why. Some of the most common reasons the SSA denies claims include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is insufficient medical documentation to validate your claim.</li>
<li>There is no evidence your disability will last for a period longer than 12 months.</li>
<li>It is not clear your disability prevents you from performing your job.</li>
<li>It is not evident that you adhered to the prescribed form of treatment from the doctors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you know the reason for the denied claim, you can gather the documentation and evidence needed to refute these reasons during the reconsideration hearing. You have 60 days from the date you received the denial letter to file for reconsideration.</p>
<p>Many applicants find it helpful to secure qualified guidance as they navigate the reconsideration process. Having help can reduce the chance you experience unnecessary complications and setbacks and can streamline the complex process of fighting for disability benefits.</p>
<p><strong>The right steps to take</strong></p>
<p>If you receive notice your claim came back denied, you may feel tempted to give up or start over with a new claim. In reality, a reconsideration of your claim may be effective. If it is not, you have the right to appeal that decision and continue your <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Disability-Claim-Appeals/Reconsideration.shtml">fight for the financial support you need</a>.</p>
<p>A smart first step you can take in this difficult process is to seek a complete evaluation of your case and an explanation of the legal options available to you. Filing for disability is not easy, but you do not have to walk this path alone.</p>

<p>We hear so much about the lengthy wait Indiana residents and Americans across the United States must endure before they can receive Social Security disability (SSD) compensation.</p>

<p>According to Social Security Administration (SSA) reports, there are 760,000 people across the country waiting to find out if they will receive disability pay, and the waiting time averages about 19 months.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>But for severe diseases, the SSA uses the system of <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/compassionateallowances/" target="_blank">Compassionate Allowances</a>, which helps the agency to expedite benefits. On the list are some forms of cancer, adult brain conditions and a number of other disorders. The Compassionate Allowances program flags claims that have conditions that meet SSA standards for disability to expedite them.</p>

<p>The list consists of several dozen conditions, ranging from acute leukemia to Zellweger Syndrome. In all, there are <a href="https://blog.ssa.gov/compassionate-allowances-speed-help-to-people-with-severe-disabilities/" target="_blank">223 conditions on the list</a>, which can be found on the SSA website, and include diseases that afflict children, as well, such as Tay Sachs.</p>

<p>The Compassionate Allowances program also make grants to researchers to help them zero in conditions that could be added to the list.</p>

<p>Social Security is paid through either the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. SSDI is for workers wo have paid into Social Security; SSI is for disabled people who have a limited income. In either case, if you are entitled to file for disability and gain access to payments to help you when you can't work.</p>

<p>When you are facing a serious, life-threatening medical condition, you should focus on your health. An attorney well-versed in Social Security Disability can discuss the Compassionate Allowances program with you, answer questions and be a resource to you through the journey of <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">filing for disability</a>.</p>

<p>Indiana residents have heard the two terms: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).</p>

<p>Is <a href="https://socialsecurity.findlaw.com/social-security-disability/what-is-the-difference-between-ssdi-and-ssi-.html" target="_blank">there a difference</a>?</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Both programs assist Americans who can't work because of a medical disability. Even though they accomplish the same task, the programs serve two different sets of people.</p>

<p>SSDI and SSI vary when it comes to eligibility. People who have paid into the program via taxes on their income and paycheck deductions may receive SSDI. The other, SSI, is for those low-income Americans who haven't earned enough money to apply for SSDI.</p>

<p>SSDI fast facts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Payroll taxes paid by the self-employed or by employers and workers pay for SSDI. People earn credits based on contributions, and there is a benchmark they must meet for eligibility.</li>
	<li>The disability must be expected to go on for at least 12 months.</li>
	<li>Monthly benefits correlate with the worker's earnings. The higher your salary, the higher your benefits.</li>
	<li>There is a five-month waiting period before you can receive benefits to give Social Security a chance to verify eligibility.</li>
	<li>After two years of SSDI benefits have been paid, disabled workers will receive Medicare coverage.</li>
</ul>

<p>SSI fast facts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Benefits are paid from general taxes and are not based on income. People who don't earn enough to qualify for SSDI can apply for SSI.</li>
	<li>Americans age 65 or older, disabled adults, or blind or disable children can receive benefits.</li>
	<li>Monthly benefit amounts are based on the applicant's resources (including personal property that includes automobiles) and income.</li>
	<li>SSI beneficiaries automatically are eligible for Medicaid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Figuring out just which program to apply for and all of the Social Security rules is tough. An Indiana attorney with experience in <a href="https://socialsecurity.findlaw.com/social-security-disability/what-is-the-difference-between-ssdi-and-ssi-.html" target="_blank">Social Security disability benefits</a> can help you figure out how the programs can best benefit you.</p>

<p>If you are an Indiana resident suffering from a loss of hearing and can't do your job because of it, you can apply for Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.healthyhearing.com/report/52874-Social-security-disability-and-hearing-loss" target="_blank">Hearing loss</a> doesn't qualify you automatically for disability, but your doctor or a hearing clinic can conduct tests to help prove your level of disability.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) uses what is called the Blue Book to determine eligibility for benefits, and the level of hearing loss is outlined in the book. So just what does the Blue Book say about hearing loss?</p>

<p>It addresses scenarios for patients whose hearing loss is treated by cochlear implants and for those who don't have the implants.</p>

<p>For people without implants, the Blue Book states you must have an average air conduction threshold of 90 decibels or higher in the better ear – or an average bone conduction hearing threshold of 60 decibels or greater in the same ear. Also a qualifier is a word recognition score of 40 percent or less in that ear, which is determined through a test that uses a standardized list of words.</p>

<p>For people with cochlear implants, the implantation represents a disability for one year following the surgery. Beyond that point, you can continue to receive benefits if your word recognition score is 60 percent or less on the Hearing in Noise Test.</p>

<p>You will not qualify for benefits if you are deaf in one ear, since your hearing loss is determined by using your best ear. In addition, if your employer can accommodate your hearing loss in some way and you still earn more than $1,190 per month, then you won't qualify for benefits.</p>

<p>Sound confusing? It is. That's why an Indiana lawyer who <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Working-With-Your-Doctor/">handles disability cases</a> can be a valuable member of your team as you and your doctor navigate the disability application process.</p>

<p>After waiting for months for a decision on your Social Security Disability claim, the last thing you want to receive is a letter saying that your claim was denied. Unfortunately, it happens frequently, even to people who are genuinely disabled.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://socialsecurity.findlaw.com/social-security-disability/why-a-disability-claim-gets-denied.html" target="_blank" >reasons for a denial</a> can vary greatly, there are some that top the list. If you're about to apply for Social Security Disability, take note of these particular problems and what you can do to overcome them.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>1. You don't cooperate with the disability examiner.</strong></p>

<p>Even if you find it frustrating, you have to make yourself available for questions from the disability examiner assigned to your case. If you don't respond to letters and phone calls, your claim is likely to be denied.</p>

<p>Keep your phone number and address updated, no matter how long the process takes, and return all contact promptly.</p>

<p><strong>2. You don't go to a consultative exam.</strong></p>

<p>If a disability examiner asks if you are willing to go to a consultative exam with an independent physician, that's code for "there isn't enough evidence in your file to approve your claim." Refuse to go, and you'll likely get denied.</p>

<p>Make yourself available for any consultative exam that's scheduled. If you aren't comfortable seeing a strange doctor on your own, take a family member or friend with you to the appointment to witness the interaction.</p>

<p><strong>3. You aren't following your doctor's orders.</strong></p>

<p>If your physician has made recommendations to help improve your health, you're obligated to follow them if you want to be approved for Social Security Disability.</p>

<p>Even if you absolutely believe the doctor's recommendations are pointless, demonstrate your willingness to get well by going to therapy, taking your medication as prescribed and keeping your follow-up appointments.</p>

<p><strong>4. You give incomplete information.</strong></p>

<p>There's a lot of paperwork that goes along with a disability claim, but you can't afford to skip any of it. Incomplete or overly-brief answers regarding the extent of your limitations and your work duties can lead to an unnecessary denial.</p>

-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Will you have to attend a hearing?</strong></p>
<p>After receiving a denial of your initial claim, you can take a series of steps to continue your fight. The first step is to request a reconsideration of your claim. If this does not work, you can then seek a hearing with an Administrative Law Judge. Consider the following facts about this step:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive at least a 20-day notice about the time, date and place of your hearing.</li>
<li>You do not have to attend your hearing in person, but it is reasonable to assume that your presence could be beneficial for your request for benefits.</li>
<li>In a hearing, there can be testimony from both witnesses and the claimant about the need for benefits.</li>
<li>Vocational experts may also speak about your disability and work-related limitations at these hearings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Appealing a denied claim can be a confusing and overwhelming process, yet you will find it beneficial to have support through every step. A hearing in front of an Administrative Law Judge can be intimidating, but applicants are entitled to have legal representation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fighting for a beneficial outcome</strong></p>
<p>Securing disability benefits can be very important for your financial well-being and the needs of your family.

<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is investigating whether it overpaid thousands of recipients nearly $400 million over the past decade and longer because of budget cuts.</p>

<p>At issue are payments to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients in Indiana and throughout the U.S. whose cases have not been reviewed in a timely manner. In fact, an estimated 1.1 million recipients have not undergone a review – known as a redetermination – in more than a decade, according to an estimate from the SSA's inspector general.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/28/improper-payments-federal-investigators-estimate-380-million-overpaid/1124277002/" target="_blank">agency has narrowed</a> it down further and is investigating whether more than 77,000 recipients might have received a total of $380 million more than they were entitled to.</p>

<p>In fiscal 2017, the government distributed $51.4 billion in SSI funds to more than 8.2 million people.</p>

<p>Redeterminations are supposed to be done each year to see if something could have changed with the recipient's situation, and once every six years if it is possible the recipient is unlikely to have had a change in circumstances. The SSA is looking for things such as a change in resources, income or living arrangements that could make a recipient ineligible.</p>

<p>Reviews formerly were done every three years, but that timeframe was doubled in the 1990s because of personnel reductions.</p>

<p>Federal investigators specifically are looking further into the cases of those 77,000 people and have mailed questionnaires to some of them. A detailed analysis of some of the cases proved that some of the recipients had been overpaid because they had too much in assets or income.</p>

<p>In one example, a woman whose case hadn't had a redetermination since 2004 was found to have received almost $10,000 too much, and the SSA sought a repayment of the overpayments.</p>

<p>The agency said it expected to finalize 2.9 million in redeterminations between Oct. 1, 2017, and Sept. 20, 2018.</p>

<p>If you are a recipient of SSI, your case could be reviewed, and you could <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Supplemental-Security-Income-SSI.shtml">require legal assistance</a> to work with the agency.</p>

<p>How can Indiana residents find out if their medical condition qualifies for Social Security Disability benefits?</p>

<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has what it calls the "blue book," which is a list of medical impairments that qualify Americans to receive payments for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), as long they meet specific qualification criteria.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>If you have a condition listed in the blue book, then you have a good chance of being approved for disability benefits. There are a number of qualifying conditions, and they include everything from respiratory illnesses to neurological disorders to mental impairments to blood disorders.</p>

<p>But what if your condition isn't on the list? Can you still qualify for disability benefits?</p>

<p>The short answer is yes, but the explanation is a bit more complex.</p>

<p>First, your condition has to have been the subject of a clinical or lab test and supported by research.</p>

<p>Additionally, the condition must affect what is called your residual functional capacity -- or the exertion limitations you have. That means what you can lift, what you can carry or even how well you can bend down or cope with conditions such as depression or anxiety.</p>

<p>No matter what your condition is, you likely will need to include results of a physical exam, MRI, CAT scan, blood panels, X-rays and other diagnostic tests with your application.</p>

<p>You will need your personal physician on your team. But you also might need to call on an Indiana attorney with experience in <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">disability cases</a> to help you with your filing -- especially if you have a condition that isn't on the list.</p>

<p>Young and healthy workers don't think about the day that might come when an injury or illness keeps them from working and supporting their family. But it could come at any instant for American employees of any age.</p>

<p>That's why it's important to know just what <a href="https://injury.findlaw.com/accident-injury-law/private-disability-insurance-vs-ssdi.html" target="_blank">forms of disability payments</a> can help pay your bills if you can't work.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>There are two types: Social Security Disability insurance (SSDI) and private insurance, and they differ in a number of ways. Here's a comparison.</p>

<p>SSDI:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you qualify, payments are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/local/disability-benefit-calculator/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.af1137b1e3a3" target="_blank">decided by a formula</a> that takes into account your work history, age and income. You will always receive less than you earned, and in some cases, up to 90 percent of what you once made, according to The Washington Post.</li>
	<li>You must show you qualify for Social Security Disability (SSD), which means you must show that you can't work in your previous occupation or do a different type of work, and the disability must prevent you from going back to work for at least 12 months.</li>
	<li>You must be fully disabled.</li>
	<li>You must have been disabled for at least five months before benefits start.</li>
</ul>

<p>Private disability insurance:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For about 30 percent of American employees, disability insurance is provided through their work.</li>
	<li>It can be purchased to protect against an unexpected loss of income.</li>
	<li>Receiving benefits often requires a lesser degree of disability, depending on the type of insurance policy.</li>
	<li>It could provide a greater financial benefit than SSD. Some policies cover as much as 70 percent of a worker's income.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully, you won't ever be disabled by injury or illness to the point that you need either SSD benefits or your private insurance to kick in. If you do, however, an attorney experienced in such cases can answer questions or help with the required paperwork. The <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/">disability claims process</a> often can present a challenge.</p>

BODY:


<p>A lot of people delay filing for Social Security Disability benefits and Supplemental Security Income for one reason — they're waiting for their doctor to tell them that they're disabled and need to file for benefits.</p>

<p>That seldom happens. Here's why.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>First, most physicians don't have a working knowledge of Social Security benefits in the first place. Why would they? Unless you have ever gone through the process of filing for disability benefits or have helped someone file, you don't really have a reason to know much about the process. Your doctor's knowledge of the programs may be limited to knowing how to fill out the forms the agency sends when it's making its determination.</p>

<p>Second, doctors usually wait for patients to bring up the subject of disability. Doctors generally want to see their patients live their best possible lives. For some patients, that means working long after a specific medical condition has started to take its toll, simply because they want to continue as long as possible in their careers.</p>

<p>Does this mean you should file for disability without bothering to talk to your doctor? Absolutely not. You really need his or her support to get through the claims process.</p>

<p>Instead, you need to make an appointment specifically to discuss the issue of disability as soon as you know you're ready to file. Here's how to go about it:</p>

<p><strong>1. Remember that your doctor knows you.</strong></p>

<p>If you have a long-standing or severe condition, your doctor knows your suffering is real. You have no reason to be nervous about this conversation.</p>

<p><strong>2. Ask your doctor's opinion.</strong></p>

<p>Say something like, "I'm having a hard time working because of my condition. Would you agree with my decision if I file for disability benefits?"</p>

<p>If your doctor agrees with your decision — great! You can go from there. If not, that's still not awful. It's better to know before you file than find out after your claim is denied. Knowing means that you have the opportunity to decide if you want to keep working or start looking for a doctor that's more supportive of your decision.</p>

<p>Once you have your doctor's support, an attorney who handles Social Security Disability cases <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Working-With-Your-Doctor/">can help you obtain the information you need</a> in order to make an effective claim for benefits.</p>

<p>When we think of a person having a disability, we often think of situations in which people are unable to physically do things. For example, a disabled person may not be able to walk and is therefore bound to a wheelchair.</p>

<p>However, disabilities are not limited to physical issues. Mental disorders and mental illnesses can mean that a person is similarly unable to perform certain essential tasks. This is why the Social Security Administration recognizes a wide range of mental illnesses, giving those suffering these illnesses the opportunity to claim disability benefits.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Is anxiety recognized as a disability?</strong></p>

<p>If a person is diagnosed with a panic or anxiety disorder by a medical professional, it may be possible for the patient to successfully claim disability benefits. This is because anxiety disorders are recognized as disabilities when certain conditions are present.</p>

<p><strong>What evidence do I need to show in order to claim disability benefits due to anxiety?</strong></p>

<p>In general, the anxiety must be severe and persistent in order for a sufferer to be able to receive <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability/" target="_blank" >disability benefits</a>. In order to establish the pervasiveness of the condition, a doctor or psychologist will have to give their opinion as part of your claim application. You must also be able to show that the anxiety is severe enough to make it impossible for you to engage in meaningful work.</p>

<p><strong>What types of disability benefits could I be eligible for?</strong></p>

<p>You may be eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Benefits depending on your needs. It is important to understand the law in Indiana before <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/" >making a Social Security claim</a> for anxiety.</p>

<p>Nearly 9 million Americans who can't work because of a medical condition receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) to help replace lost income. However, making a claim isn't easy, and its granting isn't automatic. But Indiana residents shouldn't be pessimistic. You have paid for this insurance through your payroll taxes, and you are entitled to it. You will have to make a case to receive it, however.</p>

<p>Here are the five things you should do as you <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/article/retirement/T051-C032-S014-applying-for-social-security-disability-insurance.html" target="_blank">prepare to file for SSDI</a>.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Determine if you are eligible</strong></p>

<p>Only people who meet certain conditions can qualify. You must have a medical diagnosis that is expected to last at least a year or result in your death. You must be younger than retirement age and you must have paid into the FICA system for a minimum of five of the past 10 years. Put together a list of your work history that shows when and how long you worked at each job.</p>

<p><strong>File your application immediately</strong></p>

<p>You have nothing to gain by waiting. In fact, you'll only lose money. Your application, once filed, will take months to review, and only about one-third of the applications are approved the first time around. You likely will have to wait for your appeal to be heard – a long time, in fact. The average national wait is more than 18 months. If your condition is extremely severe, the agency has a Compassionate Allowances list of illnesses that qualify for putting the benefits on a fast track.</p>

<p><strong>Change your spending habits</strong></p>

<p>Since the wait for SSDI income can be so daunting, you'll need to spend your money wisely so that you don't go through your retirement funds or all your savings, or perhaps lose your home.</p>

<p><strong>Keep your health insurance intact</strong></p>

<p>You need to continue to seek care to be able to treat your condition as well as to document it, either in your initial application or the appeal. If you can't afford insurance or medical care, inquire about low-cost or free health clinics in your area.</p>

<p><strong>Get help filing for benefits</strong></p>

<p>An attorney who works with disability applications is a good place to start. It's a complex process, and you don't want to do anything that will lead to a long determination time or a denial. Time truly is money. The <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Disability-Claim-Applications/">longer it takes to get your case approved</a>, the more money you are out.</p>

<p>You worked at your job your whole life. And then at night, you came home and cared for your now-adult child, who was born with a disability. Finally, it's time to retire and spend more time at home in Indiana with family.</p>

<p>You will be applying for your Social Security benefits soon, but while you're at it, apply for your child too.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/disability/qualify.html#anchor7" target="_blank">The law allows</a> for an adult who was disabled before age 22 to receive benefits when their parent starts receiving retirement or disability payments. The adult child is eligible for benefits under their parent's earning records.</p>

<p>An adult child can include an adopted child, and in some instances, even grandchildren, stepchildren or stepgrandchildren could be eligible. The adult child must be 18 or older, have been disabled before turning 22 and meet the disability definition.</p>

<p>The adult child never had to have a job to be eligible, but they also can't have earnings that are considered substantial. In 2018, "substantial" was defined as making more than $1,180 a month.</p>

<p>Under this scenario, benefits will be paid based on the parent's earnings record. Because of that, an application still should be filed on behalf of an adult child who already is receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or disability benefits based on their own records. A parent's earnings record could be higher, meaning their child could receive a larger monthly benefit.</p>

<p>This is a complex situation and a tough law to interpret. That's why an attorney who has experience working with <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">Social Security Disability cases </a>could be invaluable to those who go through the application process for benefits.</p>

<p>If you experience psychotic episodes, they can impact your ability to function in a professional setting. You may be unable to work, even if you are physically in good health. It's important to understand these episodes, what they involve and what they mean.</p>

<p>First of all, medical experts consider psychosis a symptom --not a disease of its own. It's also something of an umbrella term that encompasses a lot of different experiences. Generally speaking, the person who has episodes may hold beliefs that are false, exaggerated or not based in reality, or that person may have "<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248159.php" target="_blank">sensory experiences of things that do not exist.</a>"</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>These can take different forms. A lot of people have hallucinations and see things that are not there. Others believe that they are very important, even when that it is not true. It is just a delusion. In other cases, people may hear things that no one else can hear.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that the person may not understand what is happening, especially at first. They could feel afraid or confused. They may think they need to protect themselves and lash out at others around them. They may hurt themselves, either on purpose or accidentally. The person's thinking can become confusing, disordered and disorganized. In some of the worst cases, they could stop responding entirely and become catatonic.</p>

<p>If you suffer from these episodes, you know just how complex and frightening they can be. It is crucial that you get proper medical treatment, and you need to know about all of your potential <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">legal rights to Social Security Disability benefits</a>.</p>

<p>Living with a disability can be a serious challenge. Whether the problem is congenital or a result of an accident, a disability can keep a person from working, from being active and sometimes even in need of care. Assistance during those times is expensive. That is why there are social security disability benefits for those in need.</p>

<p>As we discussed in a post a few months ago, there are several types of disabilities that can <a data-mce-href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/blog/2018/09/does-your-medical-condition-qualify-you-for-disability-benefits.shtml" target="_blank" href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/blog/2018/09/does-your-medical-condition-qualify-you-for-disability-benefits.shtml">qualify a person for disability benefits</a>. The complete list can be found in what The Social Security Administration calls the blue book. Even if your issue is not in the blue book, you still may be eligible for benefits.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Among the most impactful disabilities people requesting benefits suffer from are neurological disorders. In this post we will identify a few of the most common, and most serious, neurological issues that can qualify an individual to receive social security disability benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Neurological disabilities eligible for disability benefits</strong></p>

<p>It is vital to remember that applying for benefits can be a complicated process and can also be very time intensive. One of the best ways you can advocate for yourself is to enlist the help of a <a data-mce-href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/" target="_blank" href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">legal professional</a>. They will help ensure that the process goes smoothly.</p>

<p><a data-mce-href="https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/11.00-Neurological-Adult.htm" target="_blank" href="https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/11.00-Neurological-Adult.htm">According to The Social Security Administration</a>, these common neurological disorders may allow an individual to draw disability benefits:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Epilepsy </strong>- Anyone regularly suffering generalized tonic-clonic seizures or dyscognitive seizures despite being on medication are likely eligible for disability. Limited motor functions, cognition and managing oneself are also factors. </li>
	<li><strong>Parkinsonian syndrome </strong>- Disorganized motor function in at least two extremities or serious limitation coupled with cloudy cognition, poor memory or difficulty moving may qualify an individual for benefits.</li>
	<li><strong>Cerebral palsy </strong>- An individual with cerebral palsy who has difficulty using two extremities, have difficulty managing themselves as a result of their disability or have difficulty speaking, hearing or seeing will most likely qualify for benefits.</li>
	<li><strong>Spinal cord disorder </strong>- A spinal injury or disorder resulting in loss of function, disorganized motor function of two extremities or severely limited mental faculties may qualify for social security disability benefits.</li>
	<li><strong>Traumatic brain injury </strong>- A TBI such as a concussion which results in disorganized motor function in at least two extremities for an extended period or which have a significant impact on cognitive abilities may make an individual applicable for benefits.</li>
</ul>

<p>These 5 disorders are specifically cited by The Social Security Administration as disabilities eligible for benefits. There are several variables on how long a person must have lived with the disability and its severity, however, so be sure to review the blue book and consult with an attorney before applying.</p>

<p>If you or someone you care about has been living with, or has suddenly developed, one or more of these issues, speak to a professional right away. Benefits can mean the difference between simply getting by and living the life you want to live.</p>

<p>Imagine you've developed a serious illness or disability, you can no longer hold down a job and you can't make financial ends meet. This is a terrible and difficult situation because you may need to rely on others for your financial support — if you're lucky enough to have other people in your life who are willing to help like this. Fortunately, if you're facing a situation like this, you might be able to qualify for helpful government assistance through the U.S. Social Security Disability benefits program.</p>

<p>However, just because you apply for benefits and have a serious medical condition does not always mean you'll receive immediate approval for financial assistance from the Social Security Administration (SSA). Here are <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/07/25/8-reasons-your-social-security-disability-claim-wa.aspx" target="_blank">two reasons why applicants could be denied</a>:</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>They haven't worked and paid into the system for long enough</strong></p>

<p>Individuals need to have worked for a minimum period of time while paying into the Social Security Disability system in order to qualify for benefits. The SSA will use your age and how many years you've worked to determine how much you can receive in benefits. The more you've worked and paid into the system recently, the better chances you'll have of approval.</p>

<p><strong>You are earning too much money</strong></p>

<p>Many individuals have sources of income beyond what they earn working. If you're bringing income in through other sources that exceeds $1,090 per month (unless you're blind, in which case the limit is $1,820 monthly), you probably won't qualify for Social Security Disability benefits.</p>

<p>Are you ready to apply for Social Security Disability benefits in a way that maximizes your chances of approval? Have you been denied benefits and don't know what to do? The experienced <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">Social Security Disability benefits staff</a> at our law office can help you sort out the legal aspects of obtaining these essential government benefits.</p>

<p>You know that specific mental disorders or disabilities can lead to Social Security benefits, just like physical injuries and disabilities. But do you have to suffer from something like autism or schizophrenia? What if you have severe anxiety?</p>

<p>People often do not completely understand anxiety unless they suffer from it themselves. It can be just as severe and disabling as any other disorder. Fortunately, the Social Security Administration (SSA) does understand this, and anxiety disorder is listed as a potential reason to apply for financial benefits.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>It is important to work with medical professionals to accurately diagnose the condition and list out the symptoms that you suffer from. These are <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/12.00-MentalDisorders-Adult.htm#12_06" target="_blank">some of the symptoms that SSA looks for</a> in order to consider anxiety disabling:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You become easily fatigued, which can impact your ability to work.</li>
	<li>You suffer from chronic restlessness.</li>
	<li>You are constantly irritable and it becomes hard to get along with others.</li>
	<li>You have trouble concentrating and focusing on the task before you.</li>
	<li>You see clear disturbances in your sleep schedule, such as not being able to fall asleep at night because you feel anxious and you cannot stop thinking, or you suffer from considerable muscle tension. This tension could also make it hard to sleep and lead to your fatigue and discomfort.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do those symptoms seem to describe how you have been feeling lately? If so you may qualify for benefits based on your condition, although there are other criteria involved.</p>

<p>Maybe this is a relatively new development, or maybe you have been dealing with it for years and it is just getting worse. Either way, make sure you understand your rights and what legal steps you can take to <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">get your Social Security Disability benefits approved</a>.</p>

<p>By paying your FICA, or Social Security taxes, through your job, you are covered by the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program. Should you be faced with a chronic illness or a sudden health condition that is expected to keep you out of work for a long duration, you are eligible to apply for SSDI.</p>

<p>What are the main reasons people in Indiana and across the United States <a href="https://www.kxly.com/lifestyle/5-reasons-why-people-apply-for-disability-benefits/929190269" target="_blank">apply for SSDI</a>?</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The first one, obviously, is to bring in income to help support yourself and your family. For some people, it could take years to be well enough to return to the workforce, and you'll need some income. In 2019, the average disabled worker will receive a check each month for $1,234, or about $14,800 a year. If you are disabled and have a family, the amount rises to $2,130 each month, or $25,560 each year.</p>

<p>SSDI also can help you gain medical benefits in the long term. If you are approved for SSDI, you will become eligible for Medicare 24 months after your benefits. While there often is a long wait for SSDI approval, if it exceeds 24 months, access to Medicare will begin immediately.</p>

<p>Having SSDI benefits also can increase your retirement benefits. Social Security is calculated by the amount of money you've made during your career. If you don't earn any money in a given year, your earnings will register as zero, thereby decreasing your Social Security benefits when you retire. If you have SSDI, Social Security won't count the years you made no money, thereby increasing your annual average earnings.</p>

<p>Being an SSDI recipient also can provide you with support if your medical condition improves to the point you can return to work. SSDI recipients can have a trial work period, where they ease back into the job market to see how they do back in the workplace while still receiving benefits. There also are incentives to help those who want to return to work.</p>

<p>Applying for SSDI isn't easy. There is a lot of paperwork to be done, and if it isn't properly completed, your application could be denied. And then you'll need to appeal your case and endure another wait to be heard. An attorney with experience in <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">Social Security Disability claims</a> can offer advice to help you make your application the best it can be.</p>

<p>Typically, your immune system works hard on your behalf, protecting you from sickness and disease. Your B cells are a critical part of this process, as they create antibodies. These, in turn, hunt down viruses, germs, bacteria and any other harmful substances that enter the body. They can then destroy and/or control these invaders, keeping you healthy and helping to cure all sorts of ailments in time.</p>

<p>Lupus, however, <a href="https://www.benlysta.com/lupus.html" target="_blank">is an autoimmune disorder</a>. It is a chronic disease, meaning that you don't simply work your way through it like you would with a fever or the flu. It can have a dramatic impact on your life.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>If you have lupus, your immune system does not just make normal B-cells. It also makes autoreactive B-cells. These cells, in turn, make autoantibodies. Instead of attacking viruses and bacteria, the autoantibodies turn on healthy cells and attack your body.</p>

<p>The result of this response is that you experience potentially severe inflammation. Your immune system is less effective and actively works against you in a way that it never should.</p>

<p>One issue with lupus is that it's not entirely understood, even though some treatments and medications are available. Most experts agree that it may be caused by hormones, your environment and/or your genetics, but the root cause isn't known at this time. The one bit of good news is that it's not contagious.</p>

<p>If you're suffering from lupus, it can feel very frustrating and inhibiting. It may make it difficult or impossible for you to work. Make sure you know all the options you may have to <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">seek financial assistance</a>, such as Social Security Disability. </p>

BODY:


<p>If you are struggling with a very limited income and a disability, it is important that you look into the benefits that you are likely to be entitled to. The state of Indiana has several options for those struggling financially due to health issues. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) tends to be the most appropriate option for those who have never worked or who have not worked enough to qualify for Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits.</p>

<p>You may be able to make an online application for SSI in the state of Indiana as long as you meet certain requirements. If you are between the ages of 18 and 65, unmarried, have not been married before and you are not blind, you should be eligible to make an online application. In addition, you must not have applied for SSI in the past.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>How are Supplemental Security Income applications assessed?</strong></p>

<p>There are many factors that are taken into account when an SSI application is assessed. This benefit prioritizes the most vulnerable and in-need individuals. Therefore, you cannot own more than $2,000 in assets when you apply for the benefit. The assets included in this assessment is considered as everything you own minus your home and one vehicle. In addition, you should be able to show that you are unable to gain any meaningful income because of your <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/ssi/" target="_blank">disability</a>.</p>

<p>If you have worked in the last 10 years, you may want to look into the possibility of applying for SSD benefits. Otherwise, it is important to know more about how <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Supplemental-Security-Income-SSI.shtml">Supplemental Security Income</a> might help you.</p>

<p>The next Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments for the more than 8 million people in Indiana and elsewhere who receive the benefits will be a bit higher.</p>

<p>SSI recipients are on target to <a href="https://www.fayettetribune.com/news/social-security-ssi-benefits-to-increase-percent-in/article_0a59c896-f3eb-11e8-9462-a7f60261158f.html" target="_blank">receive a 2.8 percent</a> cost-of-living-adjustment, better known as COLA. The Social Security Administration (SSA) announced the increased rates last month that will take effect December 31.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Some Americans receive both Social Security and SSI benefits, with more than 67 million people receiving Social Security. Those recipients also will see an increase of 2.8 percent.</p>

<p>Those whose benefits will increase should have received notice of such already.</p>

<p>But just what is the difference between Social Security and SSI?</p>

<p>SSI is a federal income supplement that is paid for by general tax revenues and not Social Security taxes. It helps both adults and children who are disabled or blind and who have no or very little income to meet their basic necessities, such as shelter, food and clothing. It is needs-based, and you <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/ssi/" target="_blank">must apply for SSI</a>, qualify for eligibility and be approved. Your application can be denied if you don't meet the criteria.</p>

<p>Social Security, however, generally is for retirees who can apply to receive benefits once they hit age 61 years and nine months. They have paid into the Social Security system through their earnings. And while there still is an application process, as long as you meet the requirements for retirement benefits, you will receive a monthly payment.</p>

<p>Applying for Social Security is much easier, as is getting approved. People who are denied SSI benefits may ask for reconsideration, but they will want to put forth a well-prepared appeal. An <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Supplemental-Security-Income-SSI.shtml">attorney can work with you</a> from start to finish on your application.</p>

BODY:


<p>If your hearing loss is severe and you no longer can do your job because of it, it would be in your best interest to apply for Social Security Disability benefits to help you pay your living expenses.</p>

<p>The Social Security Administration uses its medical guide, called the Blue Book, when it reviews an applicant's eligibility criteria. The Blue Book outlines when a person with hearing loss can become <a href="https://www.healthyhearing.com/report/52874-Social-security-disability-and-hearing-loss" target="_blank">eligible for benefits.</a></p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>It all starts with a hearing test conducted by a qualified professional in Indiana. To qualify for benefits, the results must meet the requirements detailed in the Blue Book. Your hearing examiner can explain these complex requirements to you. They are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An average air conduction hearing threshold of 90 decibels (dB) or greater in the better ear and an average bone conduction hearing threshold of 60 dB or greater in the better ear, OR</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>A word recognition score of 40 percent or less in the better ear determined by using a standardized list of phonetically balanced monosyllable words.</li>
</ul>

<p>People who have cochlear implants are considered disabled for a year after surgery. Once the year is over, they still may <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">qualify for Social Security Disability benefits</a> with a word recognition score of 60 percent or below.</p>

<p>If you meet the criteria but have an income of more than $1,190 per month, you won't qualify for benefits. If your workplace can modify your job, you have a job that isn't dependent on your hearing, or your hearing loss is in just one ear, then you won't get the authorization for benefits, either.</p>

<p>The disability application process can be complex, and there typically is a long wait for approval. If you have hearing loss and intend to apply for disability benefits, it would be helpful to engage the assistance of an attorney with experience in such filings. Your attorney will know exactly what needs to be included in your application to maximize its chances of approval.</p>

<p>Americans have until Friday, February 15 to give the Social Security Administration input about how pain should be measured when it comes to being eligible for disability benefits.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/12/17/2018-27169/consideration-of-pain-in-the-disability-determination-process" target="_blank">agency wants feedback</a> that will help to determine if it should change its policy about pain evaluation.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Here's how it currently works. The Social Security Administration gathers information and reviews it to see if the claimant has a medical condition responsible for pain and any physical impairments. If there is enough evidence to prove pain, further evaluation is done to measure how frequent and how intense the pain is.</p>

<p>However, since the feeling of pain is subjective, it can be difficult for claimants and their doctors to prove pain to qualify for benefits. There aren't any tests that can give a definite diagnosis.</p>

<p>The agency is seeking answers to questions that address things such as: suggestions on how pain should be evaluated; whether chronic and acute pain should be evaluated differently; and what information is available on the effectiveness or side effects of methods of treating pain.</p>

<p>Applying for Social Security disability is a tedious task that requires paperwork and doctor visits, and then a wait while your case is evaluated. It can be a long wait, too. And if you aren't approved, you are eligible for reconsideration and then a <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/">hearing to fight the decision</a>, if necessary, but that takes even more time. Any changes that could make the process easier for Indiana residents, and all Americans, to be approved for Social Security disability would be welcomed.</p>

<p>Living with a disability can make even everyday activities a real challenge. Working with a disability is usually out of the question entirely, leaving many people asking how they will make their ends meet. Fortunately, Social Security Disability (SSD) is available to help individuals in need. Better yet, mental disorders are also covered by SSD.</p>

<p>Truly debilitating mental disorders like dementia and severe cognitive issues are not the only things covered by SSD. As we discussed in an <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/blog/2018/11/is-anxiety-considered-a-disability-in-indiana.shtml">earlier blog entry</a>, issues that are becoming more understood, such as anxiety, are also covered in certain situations. Below is a list of other mental disorders that are most likely covered by SSD.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Does my disorder qualify for Social Security Disability?</strong></p>

<p>Social Security Disability is a long, often complicated process. Before filing for support, be sure to speak with <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">an attorney experienced in the subject</a>. They will help make the process as painless as possible and advocate for you should your request be denied.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, a diagnosed mental issue that is debilitating enough to keep you out of gainful employment may be eligible for SSD. This is by no means a complete <a href="https://www.disabilitybenefitscenter.org/faq/mental-disorders-and-social-security-disability">list of applicable disorders</a>, but some of the most common issues people receive SSD for include:</p>

<p><strong>Schizophrenia and paranoia</strong> - Psychotic disorders like these qualify once diagnosed and often qualify for "Compassionate Allowance" which effectively fast tracks the application process.</p>

<p><strong>Depression </strong>- Persistent depression is one of the most common issues to receive SSD. Accompanying issues like dysthymia and anhedonia are also considered factors.</p>

<p><strong>Bipolar disorder </strong>- Another mood disorder, bipolar disorder is not a direct result of brain abnormalities but is usually covered all the same.</p>

<p><strong>Anxiety related disorders</strong> - As our previous post outlined, severe anxiety disorders are covered by SSD given the proper circumstances. Panic attacks and major phobias can also be considered.</p>

<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder </strong>- Internalized issues that make it difficult to operate or communicate in society, such as OCD, are eligible for SSD.</p>

<p><strong>Developmental disorders </strong>- Mental issues that impact a person's ability to communicate, cognition, behavior or social skills - autism or Asperger's, for example - can qualify for SSD, as well.</p>

<p>If you have been diagnosed with any of the above issues and feel that they are severe enough to keep you from working effectively, consider speaking to a professional about applying for SSD.</p>

<p>A better understanding of these disorders means more people are comfortable with coming forward and asking for help. There is no shame in looking for support where it is needed, it is often just a matter of asking.</p>

<p>Older workers in Indiana, and elsewhere, could be facing the onset of dementia, making tasks they did every day on the job for years seem more daunting.</p>

<p>Employers must have difficult conversations with those valued employees. In turn, the employees likely will have a difficult time coming to terms with cognitive changes that are occurring.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) works to give rights to workers who are less than 100 percent, and that includes people with Alzheimer's disease or other <a href="https://www.news-journal.com/companies-navigate-dementia-conversations-with-older-workers/article_a7d409aa-235d-11e9-8209-af045a73f63a.html" target="_blank">forms of dementia</a>, depending on the level of impairment. Employers should work to find other jobs a valued employee can do or change how the existing job is done to continue on the job.</p>

<p>That could mean simply writing job instructions instead of giving them verbally so that they can be referred to should the employee forget. Or someone who has worked with heavy machinery, for example, could be switched to a nonhazardous desk job.</p>

<p>This is a difficult realization for some employees, who might downplay their symptoms to doctors so that they aren't labeled as "disabled" in the workplace. They want to continue their job for more than financial reasons, including pride, independence and fear.</p>

<p>But you'll want to be honest with your doctor if you are a worker facing a form of dementia.</p>

<p>The day likely will come that you need to leave the workforce and apply for Social Security Disability (SSD). <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Working-With-Your-Doctor/">Receiving disability benefits</a> requires documentation from doctors, and it's best to start that paper trail earlier rather than later.</p>

<p>"If a patient is adamantly opposed to having a certain diagnosis, they might be able to influence a certain doctor not to put that language into their medical record. And that can help you on the employment side," a former human resources executive who faced early-onset Alzheimer's disease at age 58. "If your employer wants to see medical documentation, you can show them papers that suggest you're still well enough to work."</p>

<p>But he acknowledged that is not the best long-term option because their approval for SSD could be negatively impacted by such a report.</p>

<p>As soon as you receive a diagnosis of dementia, you should consider the future, and that includes filing for SSD. Since the wait time for eligibility determination is long, you'll want professional assistance so that you'll know what steps to take.</p>

<p>We recently heard the story of a young woman from another state who has cystic fibrosis, which is a disease that leads to lung damage. Just 22, she was receiving Social Security benefits for her disability and had access to Medicaid, which covered her health care costs that come to about $100,000 a year.</p>

<p>Working outside the home isn't possible for her. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-happens-when-someone-loses-disability-insurance/" target="_blank">She told CBS News</a> that giving herself her medication and her therapy takes about six hours out of each day. She also is susceptible to infections and a variety of complications.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Last March, though, she received a letter from Social Security. Her case had been re-evaluated and her health had improved, the letter said. She no longer needed disability payments, according to the letter. Both her Social Security benefits and Medicaid were cut off.</p>

<p>"My health has only gotten worse in the past year," she told the television network.</p>

<p>It is within the law for disability claims to be reviewed from time to time to determine whether the recipient still should be receiving benefits, but what happens when the coverage stops?</p>

<p>In the case of this woman, she appealed, and Social Security relented and reinstated her benefits in November. That was just before she wound up in the hospital, and her bills, fortunately, were paid by Medicaid.</p>

<p>She is one of the lucky ones, despite the six-month wait. She got her benefits back along with her health care.</p>

<p>Not everyone is as fortunate when it comes to dealing with Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits. If you are an Indiana resident <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">having trouble with applying, receiving or maintaining benefits</a>, contact an attorney experienced with the topic.</p>

<p>You filled out all the paperwork you needed to in order to file for Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits. You went back to your doctor's office again, and again, for the records you needed. You think you made your case.</p>

<p>Then, you hear from Indiana's Disability Determination Bureau, which renews the claim on behalf of the Social Security Administration (SSA). What you hoped was a letter notifying you that your benefits were approved instead is a request.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The employees at the Disability Determination Bureau might need <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10087.pdf" target="_blank">more medical information</a> before they can rule if your physical condition qualifies you as disabled under Social Security laws. If that's the case, they'll set up a special medical test or exam that the government will pay for. Some costs for travel to take the test also could be paid.</p>

<p>If you have to cancel the appointment, the Disability Determination Bureau needs to know. If you don't inform the agency, the decision will be made without the results of the medical testing.</p>

<p>When you do go to the appointment, the doctor doing the exam or conducting the test only will collect the information or make the diagnosis the state has asked for. The doctor won't write any prescriptions or treat any conditions. The doctor is a neutral third party who isn't involved in the decision-making but will submit a report.</p>

<p>Once that report is received, the Disability Determination Bureau will review the findings, and considering the totality of your case, will make a decision. You'll receive the determination by mail.</p>

<p>If you are denied SSD benefits after your visit to the doctor, you have the right to appeal. An <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Working-With-Your-Doctor/">attorney experienced in disability cases</a> can review your paperwork and the doctor's findings to help you present the best case possible for your appeal.</p>

<p>Social Security is more than a safety net for aging Americans. The fund can also be the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/disability/determination.htm" target="_blank">source of necessary financial help if someone is disabled</a> or otherwise unable to work. The benefits can help people keep their homes and livelihoods, but the process of getting them can be long and confusing. Fortunately, the beginning of the process is relatively simple, and there are sources of help when applicants run into delays or problems.</p>

<p><strong>Where do most applications for Social Security benefits begin?</strong></p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Claims generally start with an online filing or an in-person application. Information is forwarded to Social Security Administration (SSA) field offices and authorized state agencies called disability determination services (DDS).</p>

<p><strong>What does a field office and a DDS do with a claim?</strong></p>

<p>The field office is responsible for verifying an applicant's ability to receive requirement that doesn't involve medical evidence. The DDS reviews medical information and makes a determination on a disability existing to the extent that benefits may be paid.</p>

<p><strong>Who provides medical evidence to a DDS?</strong></p>

<p>Sources referred by an applicant, like the person's doctor or treating specialist, will most likely be the first source of evidence of a disability. An independent source may be required if the original evidence is confusing or not sufficient to make a determination.</p>

<p><strong>What do I do if a disability claim has been denied?</strong></p>

<p>An attorney can help <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/">review a claim before or after it is submitted to the SSA</a>. Legal representation can assist with making, confirming and forwarding claims for necessary benefits.</p>

<p>As an Indiana residents and a disabled veteran, you could be receiving Veterans Administration disability benefits.</p>

<p>But what if the injury you suffered as part of your active-duty military service also left you unable to work at all, post-service?</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>You could be eligible for Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits, concurrent to your VA benefits. Being eligible for, and receiving, VA benefits does not mean you can't collect SSD benefits, too.</p>

<p>As part as the determination for VA benefits, your medical records will be reviewed from your time in military service. Only injuries suffered on duty or diseases acquired during such time will be considered. Evaluators will give your case a disability rating up to a score of 100, and the amount you receive will depend on the score.</p>

<p>To be <a href="http://www.dcmilitary.com/dc_military_mag/veterans_corner/receiving-social-security-disability-at-the-same-time-as-va/article_435bb669-4da9-5b80-abcb-613dc545fa49.html" target="_blank">eligible for SSDI benefits</a>, you must prove you won't be able to work for at least one year or have a condition that will lead to your death. Veterans who received a higher VA score – a 70 or greater – are more likely to be approved for SSDI benefits.</p>

<p>The Social Security evaluators will look at the full picture of your health in determining your eligibility. Therefore, your military-related disability will be looked at in conjunction with any health issue you have, such as asthma, in determining your qualification for SSDI.</p>

<p>If you have a compensation rating from the VA of 100 percent permanent and total disability, mention that on your SSDI application to expedite your claim. At the same time, be prepared to provide necessary medical evidence to Social Security that supports you are unable to work.</p>

<p>Our nation owes thanks to all of you who are disabled veterans. You are entitled to apply for all the benefits programs offered by the government.

BODY:


<p>How is the government shutdown affecting the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) claims process? Well, there's good news and bad news.</p>

<p>The good news is that existing benefits will be paid and Social Security Administration (SSA) offices will remain open -- although you can generally <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/government-shutdown-social-security-disability-checks-1269131" target="_blank">expect longer lines</a> and as well as longer wait times on the phone.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The bad news is likely to hit those who are still in the midst of the claims process or just now starting their claims. While SSA offices remain open, a number of clerical employees and <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/agency/shutdown/materials/contingency-plan-09-25-18.pdf" target="_blank">support personnel are furloughed</a> during the shutdown. In practical terms, that means you can expect longer delays than ever to get a disability claim approved and processed -- ones that will likely carry over even after the shutdown ends.</p>

<p>Similarly, those people who already have hearing dates scheduled before an administrative law judge (ALJ) should still receive their hearings. However, no new hearings are likely to be scheduled. In addition, even those who do have hearings aren't likely to get a decision until after the shutdown is over.</p>

<p>There's no one available to do the work of scheduling the hearings, transcribing the ALJ decisions and mailing out notices. In addition, you won't be able to get benefit verification letters if you are approved. Those are some of the vital tasks that SSA's clerical staff members handle.</p>

<p>The lack of benefit letters may seem relatively small, except that many people on SSDI and Supplemental Security Insurance (SSI) need those verifications in order to qualify for essential housing and medical assistance through the state.</p>

<p>No matter what's happening with the government, you still can't afford to delay filing your SSDI application. It's also important to <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/">file your appeal</a> on any denials in a timely manner -- despite the line you may have to wade through. Because of the exponential effects the shutdown may cause if it goes on, it's smarter than ever to get legal guidance for your claim.</p>

<p>You probably waited a long time – there is a months-long backlog – for a determination about your Social Security benefits. And much to your surprise, your claim was denied.</p>

<p>What are you going to do now? You were relying on that assistance to help you pay for your everyday living expenses and your medicines now that you can't work.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has an appeals process for residents of Indiana and across the country who believe they were <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/money/2019/01/06/disagree-your-disability-decision-social-security-take-another-look/2499205002/" target="_blank">wrongly denied benefits</a>.</p>

<p>The agency has put in place four levels for an appeal. They are: requesting reconsideration, a hearing, a review by an appeals council and a review by a federal court.</p>

<p>What is the difference?</p>

<p>Reconsideration: This is the starting level. Another evaluator will look at your request for reconsideration, review the documents submitted and accept any new evidence you might have. If the reconsideration upholds the initial decision, you move on to the next step</p>

<p>Hearing: Your next appeal sends your case to a hearing. You will state your case in front of an administrative law judge. You may take witnesses to the hearing, if you'd like. The judge will make a decision on your appeal based on all the information presented.</p>

<p>Review by the Social Security Appeals Council: This body either can make a decision or send your file back to the judge for an additional review.</p>

<p>Review in federal district court. This is the last step.</p>

<p>You wonder what it takes to qualify for Supplemental Security Income.</p>

<p>That's a good question that has a lot of parts to the answer.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Here's a bit of background first.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-11069.pdf" target="_blank">Supplemental Security Income</a> (SSI), run by the federal government, helps people with limited resources and income. To qualify you must be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>65 or older</li>
	<li>Blind or partially blind</li>
	<li>Disabled (including children)</li>
	<li>Be afflicted with a medical condition that prevents you from holding a job and is expected to affect you for at least 12 months or lead to your death</li>
</ul>

<p>If you qualify based on any of these stipulations, here's more you should know.</p>

<p>The 2019 basic monthly payment for those who are approved for SSI is $771 for one person. It's $1,157 for a couple. Remember that is the basic payment. You won't necessarily receive that amount.</p>

<p>You could receive a greater amount in Indiana. Our state is among those that <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-benefits-ussi.htm" target="_blank">administers and pays supplemental payments</a>.</p>

<p>Despite that, you still could have money taken off the basic rate if you or your family brings in any other income.</p>

<p>Remember, we said that <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Supplemental-Security-Income-SSI.shtml">SSI is for people of limited resources and income</a>. What exactly does that include? It's both money you bring in and what you own.</p>

<p>Your income includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Any money you earn from your job</li>
	<li>Social Security income</li>
	<li>Pensions</li>
	<li>Value of what others provide to you, such as housing or meals</li>
</ul>

<p>Your resources include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Possessions of less than a value of $2,000 for one person or $3,000 for a married couple</li>
	<li>Your bank accounts and any investments or the cash you have on hand</li>
</ul>

<p>Your resources typically don't include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The house you own, as long as you reside in it</li>
	<li>Your car</li>
</ul>

<p>SSI carries a lot of rules and conditions. You are likely to have a lot of questions. An experienced attorney could answer them for you.</p>

<p>You receive Social Security disability benefits, but money is tight. Your friend tells you about a job opportunity that you think you could do -- despite your disability -- to make a little extra cash.</p>

<p>But if you apply and get the job, how will that <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/social-security/articles/working-while-receiving-social-security-disability" target="_blank">impact your disability benefits</a>? Is it even OK to take a part-time job while receiving benefits?</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Actually, it is. If you earn less than $880 per month on the job, your disability benefits won't stop. You will need to tell the Social Security Administration about your job: the day it started, what you do there, your monthly earnings and any expenses you incur to do that job – such as taking an Uber to work because you can't drive.</p>

<p>You still can work and receive your benefits, under certain conditions, if you earn more than $880 and less than $1,220. Social Security wants beneficiaries to go back to work when their health allows, so this part-time job, at these wages, is considered to be a trial work period.</p>

<p>You must continue to be disabled and also report your work income under the trial work period.</p>

<p>Under Social Security rules, the trial period can go on until you have made $880 for any nine months during a five-year period.</p>

<p>When you hit that earnings limit of $880 to $1,220 nine times, Social Security will review your earnings. If your average monthly work earnings were higher than $1,220 in 2019 (or $2,040 if you are blind), you probably no longer will be entitled to benefits. Below that amount, the benefits will likely go on.</p>

<p>If your benefits end because your earnings are too high, they can be reinstated if your health causes you to stop working within the next five years.</p>

<p>Government rules can be complex and confusing. Before you accept that part-time job, it would be worth discussing your situation with an <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Benefits/">attorney experienced with disability cases</a>.</p>

<p>World Bipolar Day is being celebrated this year on March 30, 2019. It's <a href="http://www.worldbipolarday.org/" target="_blank">a global opportunity</a> to spread awareness about this serious mental condition, increase understanding of what victims and their families often endure and end the social stigma against mental illness.</p>

<p>Bipolar disorder (which used to be called "manic depression") is often confused with mere mood swings. In fact, it's actually a complicated imbalance of the chemicals in the brain -- and mood disturbances are only one problem that victims may experience. Some victims only experience manic phases -- while others tend to have mostly depressive phases with only a rare manic episode.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312143.php" target="_blank">Some of the symptoms</a> of mania associated with bipolar disorder include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An unnatural abundance of energy</li>
	<li>Grandiose plans and the perception that the person can accomplish anything -- no matter how unrealistic the goal</li>
	<li>Difficulty sleeping or a total lack of need for sleep</li>
	<li>Risky, dangerous behavior, such as compulsive spending, breaking the law, engaging in unprotected sex or using mind-altering substances</li>
	<li>Rapid flights of thought and speech that jump around from idea to idea</li>
	<li>A belief that they are superior to others</li>
</ul>

<p>In extreme cases, the disorder can cause psychosis, where the victim loses touch with reality entirely.</p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, a bipolar victim with depression may experience:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A total loss of energy</li>
	<li>Feelings of sadness or worthlessness</li>
	<li>Trouble sleeping or sleeping far more than is normal</li>
	<li>Constant fatigue</li>
	<li>A total loss of enjoyment in their normal daily life or favorite activities</li>
	<li>The inability to focus</li>
</ul>

<p>Some may develop suicidal thoughts, or even attempt suicide. At it's worst, bipolar depression can also cause psychosis, or a catatonic depression that makes the victim unable to move.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this disorder most commonly is diagnosed by 25 years of age, which is why many people who have it don't qualify for regular Social Security Disability benefits. Instead, however, they <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Supplemental-Security-Income-SSI.shtml">may qualify for Supplemental Security Income</a>, which is similar. If you need help filing a claim for benefits, talk to an experienced attorney today.</p>

<p>Applying for Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits is a challenging process that requires completing a lot of paperwork and visiting your doctor – probably more than once. Soon, it also could require a spotless social media presence.</p>

<p>The recently released proposed federal budget includes funding that would allow the Social Security Administration (SSA) to evaluate applicants, in part, by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-disability-benefits-your-facebook-instagram-posts-could-affect-your-social-security-disability-claim/" target="_blank">reviewing their posts</a> on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The agency's disability investigations team and the Office of the Inspector General currently review social media to look for signs of fraud, but the proposed budget would expand that.</p>

<p>"We are evaluating how social media could be used by disability adjudicators in assessing the consistency and supportability of evidence in a claimant's case file," the agency wrote in the 2020 budget proposal.</p>

<p>The proposal has raised concerns about how social media companies would keep users' data safe. For example, how would the agency be able to determine that they have located the proper John Doe on social media without the help of Facebook and Instagram officials? And how would Social Security be able to bypass privacy setting to access information without the social media giants opening up their sites to the government?</p>

<p>And what if someone who is filing for disability benefits puts something online that isn't representative of everyday life? If an applicant posts a photo of them standing atop a mountain with a caption such as, "Eureka! I made it," the assumption could be they climbed to the top. A person with the disability being claimed couldn't possibly have the ability to do that, right?</p>

<p>That photo doesn't tell the full story of how a family member drove the applicant to the top to meet others who had hiked their way up to the visitors center. Or maybe the photo was really five years old, before the applicant became disabled, but was posted as a remembrance of days past.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Social-Security-Disability-SSD/">Getting approved for disability benefits</a> already takes one year or longer, and this proposal could lengthen the process for applicants who could be forced to explain their social media posts.</p>

BODY:


<p>When people fill out their initial paperwork for their Social Security Disability (SSD) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) application, many people actually forget to include information about an important part of their medical condition: the side effects they experience from their medications.</p>

<p>The side effects that come along with many medications can add a layer of difficulty to an individual's life that isn't present with their actual disease. However, Social Security won't consider the problems your medication causes you unless you bring those side effects to their attention. That's because every drug tends to affect individual patients in unique ways. While one patient might experience relatively mild side effects from a drug that can be classified as "merely inconvenient," someone else might have a much more severe reaction that's very limiting.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>For example, let's consider just the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications/index.shtml" target="_blank">side effects associated with many common antipsychotics</a>, which are prescribed for mental illnesses like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and severe depression.</p>

<p>Some of the common side effects include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Dizziness</li>
	<li>Drowsiness</li>
	<li>Restlessness</li>
	<li>Nausea</li>
	<li>Vomiting</li>
	<li>Blurred vision</li>
	<li>Tics and tremors</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's just a partial list! Just one or two of those side effects, however, could be incredibly limiting. Imagine that you take Risperidone twice a day to control a severe mood disorder. However, each dose makes you very sleepy for several hours -- so you often have no choice but to lie down and nap until the drowsiness passes. That's important for the claims examiner who decides your case to know.</p>

<p>It's also important to let your doctor know about any side effects you experience from your medication. While they may not be able to provide you with a substitute that will work without side effects, they will note it in your chart -- and that can help you <a href="https://www.indianassdlawyers.com/The-Claims-Process/">gain approval for your Social Security Disability claim</a>.</p>

<p>Suffering a disability that will prevent you from working for the foreseeable future (at least one year) can allow you to file for Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits. When starting the process, you should enlist the help of not only an attorney, but also your doctor. Your doctor can wind up helping you immensely when <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/answers-pub042.htm" target="_blank">applying for benefits in Indianapolis</a>.</p>

<p>The most important part a doctor plays in helping you file for disability benefits is promptly providing the medical source statement. This statement explains, in detail, how much you will be able to lift, walk, stand or sit if you were to work while disabled. A doctor should be able to provide any and all limitations you will have physically if you return to work while disabled.</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>Your primary care doctor should be the person who completes all of the medical forms associated with filing for disability benefits. Do not let a doctor who has not treated any of your conditions complete these forms. This could easily lead to confusion and other problems with your application for disability benefits.</p>

<p>The same can be said for specialists. If you are sent to a specialist for a disability related to your back, you should have the specialist complete any forms required for the application. This will show the Social Security Administration (SSA) that you have consulted the proper doctor for your medical issue.</p>

<p>Working with your doctor and an experienced disability attorney when <a href="http://www.indianassdlawyers.com/Working-With-Your-Doctor/">filing for Social Security Disability benefits</a> can make the application process go much smoother than if you attempted to do it on your own. Your doctor can answer your questions, provide the proper documentation and help explain your disability to anyone who asks.</p>
