<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way we go to work is changing. With the wide availability of high-speed internet access, smartphones and laptops, it has become far easier for many employees to simply get to work at home. With remote work policies, not only do employees save time and gas by skipping the commute, but companies also get to provide a valued workplace perk without impacting productivity and the companies save money by not having to rent additional office space. However, what many employers forget to consider before allowing a remote work policy is the workers&#x2019; compensation responsibilities that come with such a policy.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Does Workers&#x2019; Compensation Apply to Remote Employees?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you may already know, workers&#x2019; compensation is focused on workplace accidents but what does that mean when a workplace can technically be anywhere? Well, the law is not simple regarding what it considers compensable if an injury were to occur while you are working remotely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you, in the course of your duties as an employee are injured, you may very well be able to seek workers&#x2019; compensation. Of course, there are some exceptions you should know about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your injury may not be compensable if:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are injured at your home and not &#x201C;in the course and scope&#x201D; of your employment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are injured outside of your home while fulfilling a non-work-related duty</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are injured outside of the remote office of your choice on a non-work-related task</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, if your injury occurs while performing some task outside of the scope of your job, it may be difficult to seek compensation. However, if you are injured while working from your home office, workers&#x2019; compensation could be pursued. &#xA0;We have litigated this issue and won at the trial level but the case is on appeal at this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees should always ensure that their remote workspace is a safe environment, removing potential trip and fall risk. Additionally, keep detailed time sheets of when you are on the clock, what duties you are completing. This will help prove your claim that your injury occurred while at work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are injured while on the job, at your home office or in your company&#x2019;s office building, immediately seek medical attention and report the injury as quickly as possible. If your employer refuses to </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/2018/10/19/workplace-accident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report your injury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their insurance company, call 1-800-342-1741 to report the accident to the State EAO office or contact them yourself with the number provided on the informational sheet (often posted in common rooms within the office).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do not have to fight for your workers&#x2019; compensation alone. Our team of </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/workers-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workers&#x2019; comp attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help ensure that you receive what you deserve after a workplace injury. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigating roadways across our region, state and country can be downright nerve-wracking. Between inclement weather, roadway construction, potholes, distracted drivers and other risks, it is extremely important to drive with the utmost vigilance at all times&#x2013;but especially if you are operating or sharing the road with a truck. Let us review a few of the most significant truck accident risks you should be aware of approaching this holiday season.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truck Accident Risks to Avoid</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Blind Spots:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Large trucks are unfortunately prone to </span><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Stay-Out-of-a-Truck%27s-Blind-Spots" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">large blind spots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Though many are equipped with multiple rearview mirrors, there are still key areas you should avoid when sharing the road. These blind spots are directly in front and behind the truck, as well as near the front left and right of the truck as well. A simple rule of thumb to determine if you are in a danger area is to see if the driver of the truck is visible to you in their mirrors. If you can see the driver, chances are, he or she can also see you. Though this is not a foolproof method, it can help you roughly gauge if you are in a safe zone.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Wide Turns and Slow Stops:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Both truck drivers and other motorists must realize that trucks, especially those hauling large, heavy cargo, take far longer to stop than an average car. Tailgating, swerving erratically and not using your turn signals around trucks can greatly increase truck accident risks and put everyone on the road in danger. Also, be aware that semi-trucks often have to take up much more room to make turns than the average motor vehicle. Give them the room they need to safely maneuver the roadways.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Distracted Driving:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For both truck drivers and other motorists, distracted driving can be a deadly mistake. From focusing on eating fast food to texting while driving, failing to keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road can leave you open to a potentially serious accident. It only takes a second for the car ahead of you to make an unexpected stop, for a careless pedestrian to begin crossing the road or for another motorist to swerve into your lane.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Drinking and Driving: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet another potentially deadly and wholly preventable mistake is drinking and driving. By lowering reaction times and affecting the high-stakes judgment calls necessary when driving, motorists should never drive while under the influence of drugs or alcohol&#x2013;even certain prescription medications. Though professional truck drivers are highly monitored to ensure they are not under the influence while on the job, fellow motorists need to do their part to ensure safety is their priority while behind the wheel. As stated above, semi-trucks are especially difficult to stop and maneuver around erratic drivers, so adding drunk or &#x201C;tipsy&#x201D; motorists can lead to heightened truck accident risks.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Inadequate Sleep: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, sleep can play a major part in avoiding truck accident risks. Reports have shown that </span><a href="http://sleepeducation.org/sleep-topics/drowsy-driving" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drowsy driving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can quite seriously affect one&#x2019;s ability to operate a car, let alone a large truck. Professional truck drivers are mandated to take adequate breaks, including sleep breaks, after clocking in a certain amount of time behind the wheel.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though there are other truck accident risks for truck drivers and other motorists to consider, the above will at very least help make you more aware of the dangers that come with sharing our roadways with vehicles of all sizes. So, whether you are a truck driver or motorist sharing the roadways with trucks, drive carefully, attentively and avoid these truck accident risks every time you get behind the wheel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are unfortunately involved in an accident involving a large truck such as a tractor-trailer or semi-truck, do not hesitate to contact our personal injury attorneys today. We understand how hectic and confusing the moments after an accident can be. Allow our team to help ensure you receive the compensation you are owed. Do not hesitate to contact Wieland, Hilado &amp; DeLattre at (407) 841-7699.</span></p>

<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Halloween is a time to enjoy spooky movies, assist your kids with some door-to-door trick or treating (while sneaking a few of their candies yourself), or celebrating the holiday over drinks with the people you love. Candy, costumes and cocktails can all be good fun, but without keeping safety in mind, your Halloween activities can get scary for all of the wrong reasons. &#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep you and yours safe, we have put together some of the top Halloween safety tips to consider, whether enjoying a Halloween party or trick or treating with your kids. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Halloween Safety Tips to Keep Your Plans More Treat Than Trick</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Best Before Dark:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Trick or treating is a tradition many parents love sharing with their kids, and one often done once the sun has gone down. Unfortunately, trick or treating after dark, especially without parental supervision, presents some major risks for your children. Ensure that your kids always use caution near roadways, wear reflective tape and/or use glowsticks and flashlights if out after dark. However, we highly recommend parents supervise their trick or treaters (especially if young) and get them back inside before sundown. </span></li>
<li><b>Stranger Danger:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Warn your children to not wander too far from home, always stay with a group of friends (and parent chaperone), and never enter a stranger&#x2019;s car or home.</span></li>
<li><b>Designate a Driver:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some adults enjoy celebrating Halloween with a party. Though spending time eating, drinking and being merry with loved ones is certainly a great idea for a fun Halloween plan, never drink and drive or allow your friends to do the same. It is easy to indulge more than intended during holiday festivities, so you should always have a designated sober driver or plan to Uber </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even arriving at the party. If you are hosting the party, ensure all guests have a safe ride home or can spend the night instead of risking injury, jail time and worse.</span></span></li>
<li><b><b>Drive Carefully: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Though safe, attentive driving is a must any day of the year, it is especially important on Halloween due to the increased pedestrian traffic, much of which will be children, who may not know to look before crossing roads. Stay off your phone, keep your eyes on the road and drive extremely carefully, especially in residential areas.</span></b></b></li>
<li>
<p style="display: inline !important;"><strong>Checking Candy:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A major concern that steals headlines every Halloween is </span><a href="https://www.csuci.edu/publicsafety/police/Halloween_candy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">candy safety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cases of tainted candy are extremely rare, but of course, it is wise to err on the side of safety when it comes to your children. Always inspect candy, ensuring that it is still in its original wrapper, and does not have pinholes or look otherwise tainted. As a rule of thumb, do not allow your children to consume homemade goods unless you personally know the neighbor who provided them.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Halloween safety tips such as those above are important to remember while enjoying the spooky, seasonal festivities. Always remember to keep an eye on your little trick or treaters, inspect your kids&#x2019; candy, never drink and drive after a Halloween party and drive with caution in residential areas. If you or your loved ones are unfortunately injured this Halloween, do not hesitate to contact our personal injury lawyers immediately. Be safe, have fun and have a very Happy Halloween.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you work in a cubicle or at a construction site, the unfortunate truth is, workplace accidents happen. Though unexpected and sometimes unavoidable, the fact that they do occur in all workplace environments means that everyone should understand what to do immediately following an accident. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety is always the priority. Immediately following an accident, ensure that you are free from danger and report the accident to your employer. Then, seek medical attention even if you do not feel like your injury is &#x201C;that bad.&#x201D; It can take hours, even days, for the full extent of an accident to manifest. If possible, document your injury through photos, videos and medical reports&#x2013;all of which can come in handy if you are forced to prove the extent of your injuries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important step to complete as soon as possible? Reporting your workplace accident. We understand that a workplace injury is not a common occurrence for most people, so you may not know where to begin. Fortunately, we have the information you need to move forward with your report and claim with confidence.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporting Your Workplace Accident</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately report your accident to your employer. That means your direct manager, supervisor or boss. Be sure to put it in writing and a keep a copy for your records.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must report the accident and injury within 30 days from your accident (or from the date your doctor says you are suffering from a workplace injury) to report the injury.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers are required to have the business&#x2019;s workers&#x2019; compensation insurance carrier information posted in a common area within the workplace. If your employer refuses to report your injury, you can contact them yourself utilizing that information, or call 1-800-342-1741 to report the accident to the State EAO office.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your employer refuses to report the injury and you cannot locate the business&#x2019;s insurance information, you can request help from the </span><a href="https://www.myfloridacfo.com/division/wc/employee/eao.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bureau of Employee Assistance and Ombudsman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When completing your injury report, you may be asked for such details as to how the injury occurred, the place, date and time of the accident, medical treatment received and the extent of your injuries. Do your best to report these facts as truthfully as possible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After submitting your report, do your best to save all medical reports, receipts of injury-related expenses, and copies of all forms and paperwork relating to the accident. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, do your best to journal about the effect your injuries have had on your everyday life and ability to work. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never give a recorded statement to your employer or workers&#x2019; compensation insurance carrier without first consulting with an attorney.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From immediately reporting your injury to your employer to keeping detailed notes and records of your injury, these steps could help you receive the claim you deserve after an unfortunate injury. The truth is, the insurance company may try to offer far less than you deserve for injuries that could have a lasting impact spanning months, years, or even a lifetime. Do not settle for less than your losses demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need guidance or assistance with your claim, </span><a href="http://whdjustice.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contact our workers&#x2019; compensation attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as soon as possible. We are here to help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding what workers&#x2019; compensation covers, and receiving benefits for lost income can be a complicated issue. You may want to seek help from your attorney. If you have any questions about this topic or any other matters, please call one of the attorneys at Wieland, Hilado &amp; DeLattre at 407-841-7699.

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3311 size-full" src="http://www.whdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rawpixel-577480-unsplash-1.jpg" alt="https://unsplash.com/photos/w9YHKTK-wLo" width="1200" height="709" srcset="http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rawpixel-577480-unsplash-1.jpg 1200w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rawpixel-577480-unsplash-1-450x266.jpg 450w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rawpixel-577480-unsplash-1-768x454.jpg 768w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rawpixel-577480-unsplash-1-1024x605.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a saying that is important to revisit from time to time: &#x201C;Nobody is perfect.&#x201D; Though a simple way of highlighting the fallibility of even the best of us, it also works perfectly for something a bit more litigious. As we know, personal injuries are unfortunately a common occurrence and require us to take a look at the impact that an accident has on a person. But as they say, &#x201C;nobody is perfect.&#x201D; Pre-existing conditions, including prior injuries or illnesses, are a major consideration in personal injury cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But do pre-existing conditions automatically mean you will receive less-than-adequate compensation for your personal injury claim? </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-Existing Conditions: What You Need to Know</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your knee-jerk reaction to having a pre-existing condition while seeking compensation for a personal injury may be that it is nothing but bad news for your claim. If you had back pain prior to an accident, you cannot claim it was caused by the other party&#x2019;s recklessness, right? Well, yes and no. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Florida, you cannot receive compensation for injuries that were not directly caused by the accident in question. However, if the accident directly resulted in the pre-existing conditions worsening or being aggravated, then they can be considered in your compensation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help contextualize, let us say a middle-aged woman named Mary deals with chronic back pain. Mary, unfortunately, suffered a sports injury in college that resulted in her dealing with occasional but recurring back pain. On the drive to her local grocer, Mary is involved in an accident when the other driver, distracted on his phone, missed a stop sign. If Mary leaves that accident with daily back pain, neck pain and other issues, the increased frequency and intensity of her back pain, as well as the other injuries, can and should be considered in her compensation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand that the other party&#x2019;s insurance company has one goal in mind, and it is certainly not to grant you the compensation you deserve. Though they may be cordial, even friendly, do not speak to them without first speaking to a personal injury attorney. When speaking to your attorney, be sure to inform them of all pre-existing conditions. Even the most minor conditions could affect your case and should be shared with your attorney. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that fighting for adequate compensation can feel like an uphill battle, especially if you are afraid that pre-existing conditions could affect your claim. You do not have to fight alone, however. Our team of </span><a href="http://whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/personal-injury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal injury attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is ready to help when you need it most.</span></p>

According to an </span><a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-pedestrian-deaths-rise-20180301-story.html"><span>article from the Orlando Sentinel</span></a><span>, Florida&#xA0;</span><span>statistically ranks among the deadliest for pedestrians, showing no signs of slowing anytime soon. With that knowledge, it is always important to think about what we, as motorists and pedestrians, can do to safeguard everyone on the road. Moreover, what does the law require us to do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let us examine the right of way laws that you need to understand before hitting the road on foot, on bike or in a motor vehicle.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida&#x2019;s Right of Way Standards</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone on the road is responsible for obeying traffic laws, including cyclists.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At four-way stops, the first vehicle to stop is also the first that should proceed. In the case that two vehicles stop at the same time, the driver to the right should proceed first.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pedestrians must use crosswalks to cross streets whenever available.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pedestrians should utilize sidewalks where available.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drivers must yield to pedestrians crossing at crosswalks but pedestrians must be sure to give drivers enough time to yield before crossing.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pedestrians are expected to yield to vehicles when crossing roadways without crosswalks or any other location that is not an intersection.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the most basic terms, drivers, cyclists and pedestrians are responsible for doing anything within their power to avoid an accident.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, with those standards in mind, what can you do to make our roadways safer every day? There are quite a few safety standards everyone should practice anytime they put their key into the ignition, mount their bike or hit the road on foot.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Skip the Cell Phone: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it is a pedestrian crossing the road while reading a text message, driver fumbling through Facebook or cyclist trying to take a call while riding, cell phones can be a deadly distraction. Silence your phone and wait until you are safely off the road. It can wait.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid Alcohol:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know that alcohol and driving do not mix but some might be surprised to hear that </span><a href="http://flbikelaw.org/2014/12/dui-on-a-bicycle-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cycling while under the influence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also illegal in the state of Florida. Pedestrians are not exempt from the dangers of intoxication on or near roadways, as they, too, could not see an oncoming vehicle, be ignorant of traffic signals or make the poor judgment call to cross anywhere but a designated crosswalk.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Utilize Safety Devices:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Drivers and their passengers should wear seatbelts, cyclists should wear helmets and equip their bikes with a flashing red tail light and headlamp for night travel. Even pedestrians can wear reflective vests and other clothing that help motorists more easily spot them.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety is Better Than Speed:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We know full well that many people do not have the luxury of taking their time when traveling to an important work function, making it to a dinner date or rushing out to get some chores done. However, the priority should always be to arrive alive, first and foremost. Obey speed limits, follow traffic signs and lights and always keep an eye out for pedestrians and cyclists.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, we can all do a better job to safeguard everyone on the roads by simply paying more attention and not forgetting tips like those above. It is easy to let safety go by the wayside when in a hurry, on a boring commute or distracted by other factors, but any of those mistakes could be fatal. Let us all work together to make Florida a safer place and, hopefully, turn the tide on our infamously dangerous roads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orlando is not just our home, but a city that many consider the international cradle of tourism. With some of the world&#x2019;s greatest theme parks, water parks and convention space, thousands upon thousands of people visit Central Florida every year. Though other tourist capitals in older, more concentrated cities have easy-to-access public transportation, Orlando&#x2019;s public transit leaves something to be desired. As such, many visitors are forced to rent a car to get anywhere while on vacation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rental cars may be a convenient solution for our visiting friends, but they also can be a bit of a challenge. Just consider the facts: a driver is operating an unfamiliar vehicle on unfamiliar roads, often in the most congested parts of town. If the driver is used to <a href="https://www.rhinocarhire.com/Car-Hire-Blog/August-2009/Which-Countries-Drive-on-the-Left,--a-Handy-Guide.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driving on the opposite side of the road</a> (visitors from the UK, Japan, Ireland, etc.) or in right-hand drive vehicles, matters can be even more confusing. This can all lead to the unfortunate possibility of a rental car accident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you have friends or family visiting or are planning a trip, you should know a few important facts about rental car accidents and the insurance policies that may help.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coverage in a Rental Car Accident Case</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Personal Car Insurance vs. Liability Coverage:</strong> Many car rental companies will immediately offer some form of liability coverage on your rental. Though it may sound like a smart option to take, many personal car insurance policies will cover you in a similar capacity. Specifically, this insurance will cover the other party&#x2019;s damages (both property and medical) from an accident you caused.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Optional Damage Coverage:</strong> You may be offered an optional &#x201C;damage waiver&#x201D; that essentially dictates that damage to, or theft of, the rental car will be waived by the rental company. There are some notable limits to this waiver, including if the damage occurred while an unauthorized driver was at the wheel or due to reckless driving.</span></span></li>
<li><strong></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Personal Effects Coverage:</strong> This coverage is for personal effects left in the rental car that may be lost, damaged or stolen. Though largely unnecessary, it may be an option worth considering if transporting valuable goods in the rental vehicle.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Personal Accident Insurance:</strong> Essentially the opposite of personal car insurance, this coverage includes the injuries of the driver and passengers of the rental car. This may be wise to consider, though one&#x2019;s personal injury protection coverage could already work in a similar capacity.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is essential to remember is that insurance policies vary wildly. Before assuming your insurance policies will overlap with the rental car company&#x2019;s coverage, be sure to double check the exact details of your plan. Though you do not want to pay more than you need to, you also want to ensure that you are protected from the immense costs associated with car accidents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better yet, do your best to avoid a rental car accident altogether by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Always obeying the posted speed limits</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Never texting and driving, drinking and driving or otherwise driving distracted</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Taking time to get accustomed to the vehicle before taking it on the highway or busy roadways</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Map out your specific course of travel beforehand</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though there are many coverage options and ways to avoid accidents, the question still stands: Who is liable in a rental car accident? As you can see, these waivers and insurance coverages can help protect you. However, when you sign on the dotted line for a rental car, you are agreeing that any damage, even from an accident that you are not at fault for, is your responsibility. For that reason, we recommend reading the fine print, understanding the limitations of your insurance policy (and those offered by the rental company) and driving with the utmost care to avoid a rental car accident. Be safe and share these tips with your visiting friends and family so they may do the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long before the theme parks came to town, Florida was known for its natural beauty. From the famous <a href="https://www.nps.gov/ever/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everglades</a> to picturesque beaches, there are some truly unique spectacles provided by Mother Nature herself. Though Central Florida may not be home to the likes of Yellowstone or Joshua Tree, there are certainly more than enough state and national parks within driving distance for the outdoorsy adventurers among us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though our parks are an asset worth visiting, you should also understand that there are inherent dangers involved with the great outdoors, especially if one strays from the beaten path. Before you or yours expose yourself to potential dangers, be sure to consider the following before your next trip.</span></p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida State Park and National Park Safety Tips</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Not a Theme Park:</strong> Locals and tourists more familiar with our local theme parks may forget that, though state and national parks are relatively safe, they are still in the often unpredictable outdoors. From erratic weather to wildlife dangers, you must still keep your eyes and ears open while exploring.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> See the Signs:</strong> Posted signs are incredibly important to your safety and the safety of others. Warning signs that caution visitors about dangerous wildlife, loose footing or fast currents can be the difference between a fun hike and a trip to the hospital if you are not careful.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Keep to the Path:</strong> Though going off of the beaten path can be fun for the adventurous types, it is also an easy way to put yourself at greater risk than necessary. Keep to marked trails or designated visitor areas, especially if you are not an experienced hiker or outdoorsman. Note that some areas off of a trail may be prohibited, so always keep an eye out for cautionary signage.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Come Prepared:</strong> Being in the great outdoors can be exciting, but exhausting, especially in Florida&#x2019;s sweltering summer heat. If you will be spending any amount of time in the elements, apply sunscreen, bring water and wear appropriate footwear and clothing for your adventure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, your next adventure in Florida&#x2019;s great outdoors is a safe one. By using caution, heeding warning signs, keeping to designated paths and coming prepared, you can avoid serious injury and enjoy all of the natural wonders the Sunshine State has to offer.</span></p>

<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When discussing safe driving, we have often covered the dangers of speeding, driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol, and other common risky and very dangerous habits people may have behind the wheel. Much like these risks, the topic of this post is absolutely preventable but often overlooked. That risk is the sun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though you certainly have no control of when the sun rises and falls, its predictability is a major plus for those trying to drive safely. Unlike random, erratic drivers one may encounter on a trip to the grocery store or heading to work, the sun is a known quantity&#x2013;it has a schedule and sticks to it. Knowing the times when the sun is glaring most brightly through your windshield can help you prepare (and avoid spending your commute squinting) in the following ways.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tips on Avoiding a Glare-Related Accident While on the Road</span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><b>Check Your Route: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we all know, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. If your commute back home has you facing westward for the majority of the trip, consider another route (the same goes for eastward routes in the morning). A simple change of direction can work wonders.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><b>Not Just Any Sunglasses:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Though you may have a pair of dollar store shades in your glove compartment, they may not be quite as effective as you need to stay out of danger. Spring for </span><a href="http://visionsource.com/blog/polarized-lenses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">polarized sunglasses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as they do a good job of filtering out glare and can keep you seeing more clearly than traditional lenses. Well worth the upcharge if it can keep you from a costly accident.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><b>Keep it Clean: <span style="font-weight: 400;">From dead bugs to dirt and dust, your windshield can be a magnet for smudges and smears. Be sure to regularly clean both the inside and outside of your windows to keep smears from making sun glare even worse. You may even want to keep a microfiber cloth handy in your glove compartment to wipe away smudges before you hit the road.</span></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Advised Use of Visor:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">An often forgotten but greatly helpful tool to use is your visor. Utilizing a visor can block out the sun, acting almost like the bill of a baseball cap to shade your eyes. Just be sure that the visor is not obstructing your view of the road or traffic lights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sun is a powerful thing&#x2013;capable of bringing life to plants, powering homes and giving poolside loungers a nice tan. However, that glowing orb in the sky can also cause serious visibility issues when on the road. By alternating your route, investing in polarized sunglasses, keeping your windshield clean and utilizing your car&#x2019;s visor, you can potentially prevent a serious and preventable car accident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, if you do cause a car accident due to sun glare, you are most likely going to be found liable for damages. Though an element of nature, the sun&#x2019;s predictable nature keeps it from being ruled an &#x201C;Act of God,&#x201D; therefore, putting the onus on you to do what you have to in order to drive safely. Simply put, if you cannot see the road ahead, whether due to rainfall, snowfall or sun glare, you cannot operate your vehicle safely. Always drive with care and do whatever it takes to safeguard yourself, fellow drivers and pedestrians. </span></p>

<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With many of us enjoying the summer months by taking a trip out to the coast or perhaps a much-needed vacation to reset and refresh as we pass into the second half of the year. Unless flying, travel often means hours spent on the highway system, which can mean high-speed driving and unfamiliar roadways. Before you hit the road, review these highway safety tips to follow all summer long (and beyond).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highways Safety Tips and Laws</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Speed Limits:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Though you may be able to cruise at far higher speeds than local roads, highways still have posted speed limits that you should abide. While in the flow of traffic or driving down an empty highway it is easy to lose track of how fast you are going, so try to keep an eye on both the limit and your traveling speed. Remember, speed limits are posted for your safety. An unexpected stop, roadway obstruction or construction could spell doom if you are not respecting the dangers of higher-speed highway driving.</span>&#xA0;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Roadway Construction:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Always keep your eyes open for roadway construction, slowing down looking for possible traffic flow changes as you approach the work. Though construction sites should be clearly marked and visible, variables such as poor weather or sun glare may make them difficult to spot, so always be vigilant. </span>&#xA0;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Safe Driving:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Though safe driving is always important, when driving for long stretches at higher speeds than local roads allow, you should be all the more careful. Always use your turn signals before changing lanes, never tailgate and remember that the farthest left lane is the passing lane. If a faster-moving vehicle approaches you while in the left lane, </span><a href="http://docs.google.com/a/findsomewinmore.com/document/d/1kak-2xCLVhvG_mntcy1ykZ75aukxPxBguvcr7I_ve0o/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires you to allow them to pass.</span>&#xA0;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Semi-Truck Safety:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When traveling on most highways, it is common to </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/2018/03/30/semi-trucks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">share the road with 18-wheeler trucks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carrying large loads. Give these vehicles more space than necessary, as their large size makes them slower to stop and more difficult to maneuver around danger. These trucks are also notorious for their large blind spots, which you should do your best to avoid.</span>&#xA0;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Drowsy Driving:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Though you may be relatively safe driving a couple hours to the beach or making your daily commute, long-distance driving can lead to something the National Sleep Foundation claims is similar in effect to drunk driving: </span><a href="https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/drowsy-driving-vs-drunk-driving-how-similar-are-they" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drowsy driving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even being awake for 18 hours straight can lower your reaction time, so plan your longer trips with multiple drivers or overnight stays in mind. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you combine these highway safety tips to common sense practices, such as never driving under the influence, avoiding distracted driving and always wearing seat belts, you can make your next beach or road trip far safer. Follow speed limits, slow down for roadway construction, practice safe driving habits, use caution around semis, and do not drive drowsy.

<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riding motorcycles are a lot of fun and quite enjoyable, however, riding a motorcycle is risky. When you share the road with drivers protected by tons of steel, who may be more focused on their smartphones than driving, you are forced to accept a certain level of danger every time you mount your bike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, riding a motorcycle remains an exhilarating experience for many who enjoy it as a lifestyle, hobby or an easy way to get from point A to point B. But now that summer is in full swing, afternoon thunderstorms are a nearly daily risk that could easily cause a serious motorcycle accident if you are not prepared. &#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what should you know to avoid a motorcycle accident during a storm? These tips may help the next time your ride turns wet.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motorcycle Safety Tips for Riding During a Storm</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Gear Up: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the summer months may be hot, gearing up is essential to safety when riding. If you think you may get caught in rain, consider wearing a </span><a href="https://www.outsidepursuits.com/best-motorcycle-rain-gear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rain jacket, rain pants or an entire rain suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to stay as dry as possible. If you use an open-face helmet without a wind guard, be sure to always use eye protection, as rain can severely limit your vision.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Watch Your Roadway: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though wet roads are slippery, manhole covers and even the painted lines of the roadway are often far slicker. Avoid these common risks, especially when coming to a stop or attempting a turn. Also keep an eye out for puddling water on the roadway, sticking to drier lanes when possible. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Be Cautious at Intersections:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When stopped at intersections, some vehicles, unfortunately, leak oil onto the road, making an already slippery wet road an even bigger risk. Use caution when stopping and accelerating at stop signs and traffic lights.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Slow it Down: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though motorcycles are often praised for their quick acceleration, you should ease off on the throttle when the roadways get wet. Do not follow fellow motorists too closely, signal before turns and always keep an eye out for impaired or distracted drivers whose reaction time may be compromised. Remember, your bike will stop slower when the road is wet. Give yourself more time and space than you need to arrive alive.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Wait it Out:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When in doubt, wait it out. Though summer storms are frequent, they are also often quick to pass. If you are unprepared or see a storm turning for the worse, never risk riding when you can simply hit the road once the coast is clear. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone with real-world experience on a motorcycle knows that roadways and fellow motorists can be unpredictable. You need to ride defensively, anticipating the worst at all times in order to protect yourself from the unknown potential threats around every bend. These threats, however, only multiply when you add water to the mix. By wearing rain gear, keeping your eyes out for slick spots on the roadway, using caution at intersections, slowing your speed and waiting out especially bad storms, you can potentially avoid a serious motorcycle accident. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every summer, Americans come together to celebrate our country with loud fireworks, hot grills and cold drinks. The 4th of July can be a fantastic time to spend with loved ones but comes with a fair share of risks of which you should be cautious. Prepare for the festivities and fun with these 4th of July safety tips.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five Important 4th of July Safety Tips</span></h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Fireworks:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A staple for the occasion, fireworks play a big part in many 4th of July celebrations. However, when not handled with care, fireworks can also cause serious injuries. Always use caution when lighting fireworks, being sure to do so safely outside and away from guests. For young children, you may also want to provide ear protection. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, be conscious of pets that may be spooked by the loud fireworks. It may be wise to keep dogs and cats safely in a room until the festivities end.<p></p>
<p></p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Grilling:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whether grilling up cheeseburgers or bratwurst this 4th of July, you need to prioritize safety when dealing with open flames and potential food safety issues. Keep children away from the grill and never leave it unmonitored. Even stepping away from five minutes is an unnecessary risk, as flame ups can happen in just seconds. Ensure that your grill is safely placed far enough from your home or overhead structures that may be at risk of catching fire if flames rise too high.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, be sure to cook all food to a </span><a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/mintemp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">safe minimum temperature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Undercooking food can put you at risk for E. coli, salmonella and food-borne illnesses that you certainly want to avoid.<p></p>
<p></p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Swimming:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many Americans enjoy the taking a dip in the pool or heading to one of Florida&#x2019;s beaches for the holiday. Swimming can be great fun for the whole family, but be sure to never leave children unaccompanied. Instruct your kids to never run on the wet pool deck or inside after getting out of the pool, as slip and fall risks are common on wet, hard surfaces.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida&#x2019;s summers are notorious for extreme weather changes. Be sure to check the weather forecast the morning of the 4th to plan out your outdoor activities so you are not caught in a dangerous thunderstorm. If a storm does sneak up on your beach day or poolside relaxation time, immediately seek shelter at the first sign of thunder.<p></p>
<p></p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Sunscreen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even if you are not planning on a day at the beach or poolside, if you are going to be outside, sunscreen is a must. The sun&#x2019;s powerful rays can make their way through clouds and even some clothing, making even minutes outside put you at risk of burning without some protection. Apply sunscreen, reapply as needed and consider wearing a hat and sunglasses for added eye protection.<br>
&#xA0;<br>
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Alcohol:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As always, alcohol should be enjoyed responsibly. A holiday is no excuse for recklessness, especially when many of the activities associated with the 4th can be dangerous if not done with safety as a top priority. Practice moderation and do not drink and drive this 4th of July.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though there are many risks associated with the holiday, these 4th of July safety tips can keep you and your loved ones safe while you enjoy fun in the sun. Use caution with fireworks, grill safely, watch your children when swimming, apply sunscreen and drink responsibly&#x2013;it is the American way.</span></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3245 size-full" src="http://www.whdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/goh-rhy-yan-472415-unsplash-1.jpg" alt="negligence" width="1200" height="800" srcset="http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/goh-rhy-yan-472415-unsplash-1.jpg 1200w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/goh-rhy-yan-472415-unsplash-1-450x300.jpg 450w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/goh-rhy-yan-472415-unsplash-1-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/goh-rhy-yan-472415-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department store employee who sees a potentially dangerous spill on the floor, yet does nothing. The driver who was snapping a new story on Snapchat while driving home. The crane operator who comes to work under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The homeowner who fails to pick up his gardening tools littering the public sidewalk. All of these individuals could easily be considered broadly negligent in the court of public opinion, but what does the law have to say?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, as is often the case, litigious standards are a bit more well-defined and rigid. Before you find yourself negligent in a case or unsure of the level of negligence of another party, learn how negligence is determined and defined in litigation.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determining Negligence: The Four Elements</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negligence can be broken into four main elements of consideration, including:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Owed Duty:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Was there a legal duty of care owed to the injured party? For instance, when you legally own and operate a motor vehicle, you have a legal duty to operate your vehicle safely. The same can be said for doctors who have a legal duty to provide adequate, competent care. If you are a store owner, you have a legal duty to ensure your place of business is safe for your employees and customers (as well as anyone else on your property). Even trespassers get a minimal level of duty of care, as people are not legally allowed to set up booby traps on their property, for instance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Breach of Duty:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Once it is determined that some level of duty was owed, it can then be decided whether that duty was breached based on whether the average person would have acted differently in the situation, knowing what the defendant knew at the time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Causation:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even if the above two points show that the defendant acted negligently, that alone is not enough to be proven responsible for injuries or damages. It must be proven that the defendant&#x2019;s negligence </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">caused the injury or damages. Additionally, it must be proven that the defendant should have reasonably foreseen the potential danger of their action or inaction. A freak accident, for instance, may not be determined a the result of negligence.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Damages:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Finally, adequate compensation is determined for the injured party, including repairs on vehicles and property, hospital bills and rehabilitation costs.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you, a friend or a loved is injured because of someone else&#x2019;s negligence or should you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact Wieland, Hilado &amp; DeLattre, P.A. at (407) 841-7699. &#xA0;For additional resources, keep checking our blog, like us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whdattorneys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href="http://twitter.com/whdjustice">Twitter</a> for more helpful hints and to always be informed about best practices in law.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3240 size-full" src="http://www.whdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/joanna-kosinska-288965-unsplash.jpg" alt="glass of water" width="1200" height="801" srcset="http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/joanna-kosinska-288965-unsplash.jpg 1200w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/joanna-kosinska-288965-unsplash-450x300.jpg 450w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/joanna-kosinska-288965-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/joanna-kosinska-288965-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></span></p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the summer heat already upon us, we all need to be aware of not only potential skin damage from the burning rays of sunshine but also the dangers of dehydration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dehydration occurs when you use and lose more fluid than you intake, and your body doesn&#x2019;t have enough water and other fluids to carry out its normal functions. Simply put, if you don&#x2019;t replace lost fluids, you will get dehydrated. Note that n</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ot all liquids help with rehydration. Diuretics, such as coffee and tea, actually cause you to lose water more quickly. Drinks high in protein and alcoholic beverages can also dehydrate you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to drink, what liquids can help your body stay healthily hydrated? Experts suggest drinking water, sports drinks with electrolytes, and fruit juices. Sip water often rather than drinking a large amount once every few hours, as your body is constantly sweating to try to cool itself and can dehydrate gradually throughout the day.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Symptoms and Risks of Dehydration</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to failing to apply sunscreen in the heat of the summer, not drinking enough water can lead to serious, even life-threatening, health problems. Dehydration can lead to heart failure, rapid heart rate and can lower blood pressure if gone unchecked. Some signs of dehydration to look out for include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dry Mouth</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decreased Urine Output</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very Yellow Urine</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headache</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dry Skin</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiredness and Lethargy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dizziness</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased Thirst </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that diabetics are especially susceptible to dehydration and should be extra vigilant about their water intake. Additionally, young children and older adults are at high risk of dehydration and associated health problems. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Can I Stay Hydrated Throughout the Day?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether going grocery shopping, heading to work or sitting by the pool, always bring a water bottle with you. To reduce costs and plastic consumption, carry a reusable water bottle that you can refill at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though water can be boring for those of us who enjoy a bit of variety throughout the day, you can experiment with <a href="https://wellnessmama.com/3607/herb-fruit-infused-water/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infusing water</a> with fruits, such as strawberries, lemons, blueberries and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many have been told that six-to-eight glasses of water per day is sufficient, but different people need different amounts of water to stay hydrated. For instance, if you are very active, work outdoors or exercise often, you may need to hydrate before, during and after activity to stay healthy. It is good to know the warning signs of dehydration, but don&#x2019;t wait until you feel thirsty before you drink something. Prevention is the name of the game.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dehydration Dangers in the Workplace</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Wieland Hilado &amp; DeLattre, we have worked closely with clients who were unfortunately not provided enough water on work sites, resulting in injury. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When employees work in hot temperatures, particularly if tasks involve heavy manual work, dehydration can occur very quickly. To address this risk, employers must provide adequate amounts of cool water at work areas and should encourage employees to drink water every 15 minutes. During rest breaks, employees may also drink sports drinks as an acceptable alternative for fluid replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you, a friend or a loved one were unfortunately injured as a result of <a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/workers-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workplace negligence</a> or simply have questions, do not hesitate to contact Wieland, Hilado &amp; DeLattre, P.A. at (407) 841-7699.

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3231 size-full" src="http://www.whdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/neonbrand-357940-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="789" srcset="http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/neonbrand-357940-unsplash.jpg 1200w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/neonbrand-357940-unsplash-450x296.jpg 450w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/neonbrand-357940-unsplash-768x505.jpg 768w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/neonbrand-357940-unsplash-1024x673.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our blogs, we have written extensively about the dangers of distracted driving. From eating breakfast on your morning commute to focusing on in-car conversations more than the road ahead, there are many factors that can take your mind, eyes or hands away from the task of safe driving. Though any distracting factor while driving can be a danger when driving, chief among them is your cell phone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a constantly beeping, vibrating, chirping device that acts as a portal to your friends, family and the internet, it is easy to see why. Though you may assume your cell phone is public enemy number one when it comes to distracted driving, you might be surprised by the different ways it can safeguard you while on the road.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cell Phone Distracted Driving Prevention</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Bluetooth Functionality:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Before Bluetooth headsets and in-car Bluetooth functionality, people were forced to take a hand off the steering wheel to make or take a call. Luckily, many new cars have Bluetooth technology that allows for hands-free calls. Additionally, people can buy very inexpensive wireless headphones that allow for hands-free calling. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note, however, that even hands-free calling does not mean distraction-free calling. Though your eyes may be on the road and your hands may be on the wheel, if your mind is not focused on the act of driving, you could still be at risk. When possible, take the call when you have safely arrived at your destination.</span></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><b><b>Driving Mode: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Though not all phones have this function &#x201C;baked&#x201D; into their operating systems, some allow you to enable a </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-simple-solution-for-distracted-driving-1446218317" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">driving mode</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that mutes notifications from social media, text messages, calls, games and more.</span></b></b></b><b><b><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem? This functionality only works if users choose to enable it. With many unwilling to pause their social and social media lives, it may not be effective without education on the dangers of texting and driving.</span></b></b></b>&#xA0;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Anti-Distraction Apps:</strong>&#xA0;<span style="font-weight: 400;">For phones without a built-in driving mode, there are some </span><a href="https://www.dmv.org/distracted-driving-apps.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available that can keep you and your children safe while driving. These apps allow drivers to:</span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send parent notifications</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Block texts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Block calls</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Track safe miles driven</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide rewards for safe driving</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share driver&#x2019;s locations</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make no mistake about it: using your phone while driving is dangerous. However, by utilizing Bluetooth hands-free devices, enabling your phone&#x2019;s driving mode (if available) and using anti-distraction mobile apps, you can avoid distracted driving. Just remember, that call, text or Facebook notification is not worth risking your life or the lives of fellow drivers, cyclists and pedestrians you may not see before it&#x2019;s too late. Drive safely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you, a friend or a loved one are unfortunately injured as a result of the negligence of someone texting and driving or have any questions, do not hesitate to contact Wieland, Hilado &amp; DeLattre, P.A. at (407) 841-7699. &#xA0;For additional resources, keep checking our blog, like us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whdattorneys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href="http://twitter.com/whdjustice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> for more helpful hints and to always stay informed on best practices in law.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a car accident, often all you want is for the whole ordeal to be over. Some people are willing to do whatever it takes to take care of it, even if it means rushing through all the important details so they can simply move on with their lives. That is not always the smartest way to go about it, especially in regards to working through your insurance claim. Whether you are speaking with the other driver&#x2019;s insurance company or even your own, here are four tips for navigating the fine line of what to say and what not to say after a car accident.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Should I Do or Say After a Car Accident?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Just say no&#x2026;for now.<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been in an accident, we strongly recommend that you consult with an attorney before providing a recorded statement to any insurance adjuster, including the adjuster for your own insurance company. This recommendation applies especially if you are injured or feeling sore after a car accident.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though you may be obligated to give a recorded statement to your own insurance company, if you are injured you should consult with an attorney before doing so. Again, remember that you are not required to give a recorded statement to the other driver&#x2019;s insurance company at all.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance adjusters are trained to save their company money by asking strategic, scripted questions that can get you to open up about certain aspects of the accident or your injuries. They are basically skilled negotiators and can potentially catch you saying what was not intended, but what they want to hear, simply because you did not understand the question or did not know what was specifically being asked. </span></b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do give a statement to the insurance adjuster, recorded or not, it is strongly recommended that you stay calm and be sure you fully understand the question being asked before responding. Politely but firmly decline the insurance adjuster&#x2019;s request to record your account of what happened. Tell him or her that you are not comfortable with recording the exchange and that, when your information is complete, you will provide your official statement in writing. Do not forget to always be honest when answering questions after consulting your attorney.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>You have the right to remain silent.</strong><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When speaking to the insurance adjuster you are only required to provide a limited amount of personal information. It is fine to share your name, address, and phone number, etc. It is also safe to describe what you do for a living and sharing the name of your employer, how long you have worked there and other similar details. You should not, however, share much more additional information. &#xA0;Instead, consult with an attorney before doing so.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance adjusters may formally ask you to describe what happened, or they may keep it more casual and conversational, but this is a tactic to get you to open up and share as much as possible.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&#x2019;t rush.</strong><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember how you just want this whole experience to be over as quickly as possible? Well, don&#x2019;t rush to settle the claim with the insurance adjuster too quickly. It is an essential part of their job to offer you a settlement during your first couple phone conversations. When they can get the claim resolved and settled right away it usually saves the insurance company money.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly though, you risk settling before knowing the full extent of your injuries. How often have you heard of someone getting in an accident and feeling fine only to begin showing symptoms within hours or days? It is common for injuries from bad collisions to take time to manifest fully. Meaning? You may settle for too little if you settle too early and will not be covered for the extent of your condition. It is tempting to settle early, but you may end up paying more out of pocket in the end.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also be pressured rather hard to give a recorded statement right away, claiming that whoever makes the statement first is better protected. This is not true. Be aware that when pressured like this, you may not give the most accurate or calm account of what really took place. Instead of a detailed and true statement, you may unintentionally leave out a key detail or certain important aspects of your claim. The concept of being recorded often causes all of us to act and speak differently. This is a big reason why a written statement is a better way to go.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></li>
<li><strong>Know what is expected of you.</strong><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjusters may tell that you are required to give a recorded statement. Before just accepting their word for it and doing so, you do have the right to ask your adjuster to provide you with a copy of your policy or the other driver&#x2019;s policy and show you specifically where within the insurance policy that you signed that it requires you to provide a recorded statement.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although we do not recommend that you give a recorded statement to an insurance adjuster before consulting with an attorney, if you choose to do so, it is very important that you provide an accurate history to the insurance adjuster. Insurance companies are always looking for reasons to deny claims or minimize the value of claims.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, you should not give a recorded statement to an insurance representative without the guidance and counsel of an attorney. If you do deny the representative&#x2019;s request, be courteous but firm. No matter how friendly and caring they may seem on the phone, never forget that they are employees and representatives of the insurance company&#x2019;s interests&#x2013;not yours.</span></p>

<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although boating in Florida can be done all year long, boating season is starting to crank up with Memorial Day Weekend approaching and summer months just ahead. Boating can be good fun for the whole family but be aware that no one under the age of 14 may operate a watercraft in Florida at any time, even if he/she possesses a <a href="http://myfwc.com/boating/safety-education/id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Boating Safety Education Card</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is recommended that boaters at any age to obtain a Florida Boating Safety Education Card, but if you were born after January 1, 1988 and plan to operate a watercraft in Florida, you are required to possess this verification card. You can acquire your Florida Boating Safety Education Card online and for free. Another age barrier to be aware of is that no one under the age of 18 is legally allowed to rent or lease a watercraft. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boating Under the Influence</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know the incredible dangers that come with drinking and driving; the risks of arrest, property damage, and serious personal injury or even death. Yet, even with these risks widely known, there were still </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">676 drunk driving fatalities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year in the state of Florida alone. Now that we&#x2019;re deep into the summer months, many people are trading time on the road with time on the water, enjoying the many great boating and fishing spots all over the Central Florida area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, there are some key Florida laws and independent regulations that you should know before boating under the influence.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boating under the influence </span><b>is against the law</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Just like driving under the influence, if you test at or higher than a .08 while operating a vessel, you are breaking the law.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open container laws are not as simple as you think. In open water, open container laws are ineffective. However, in many private waters </span><b>you may be ticketed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if open alcohol containers are not allowed on that property.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being convicted of boating under the influence is a </span><b>serious offense</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For your first conviction, you face up to $1,000 in fines and 6 months of jail time. By your third violation, you could face up to 12 months of imprisonment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The safe bet? If you want to enjoy some drinks, do so on the mainland with a designated driver. It is not worth the fines, serious jail time, injuries or deaths that could be caused by letting your summer fun turn reckless while boating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you, a friend or loved one is injured due to the recklessness of an intoxicated boater, please do not hesitate to contact us to speak with an attorney at 407-841-7699.

TITLE: How Can an Indemnification Agreement Affect a Personal Injury Case Involving Your Injured Child?

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3214 size-full" src="http://www.whdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/janko-ferlic-303881-unsplash.jpg" alt="personal injury" width="1200" height="900" srcset="http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/janko-ferlic-303881-unsplash.jpg 1200w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/janko-ferlic-303881-unsplash-450x338.jpg 450w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/janko-ferlic-303881-unsplash-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/janko-ferlic-303881-unsplash-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all started with an ear piercing. A 13-year-old girl walked into a Claire&#x2019;s store in 2012 with her mother and walked out with an infection that would result in prolonged medical treatment, hospitalization, and deformity of the girl&#x2019;s ear. Though seemingly an open and shut personal injury case, the details make it anything but simple. While at the boutique, Mom signed an agreement that stated:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am the parent or legal guardian of a minor under 18 years of age, and I hold only myself liable and hereby release and waive any and all claims that I or the minor may make as a result of this ear piercing. &#xA0;I further agree that I shall indemnify and hold Claire&#x2019;s harmless with respect to any and all claims that I or my minor child may make as a result of this ear piercing, even if due to the sole or join negligent acts or omissions of Claire&#x2019;s Boutiques, Inc., its agents or employees. </span></i></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Case</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite signing this release, the mother decided to take the case to court on behalf of her daughter after her daughter suffered a serious ear infection following the ear piercing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At trial, Claire&#x2019;s attempted to establish that its staff was indeed trained on how to pierce ears, sharing that staff had to pass a written exam before being allowed to pierce ears. However, Claire&#x2019;s did not provide evidence that their staff was trained on how to properly sterilize equipment and was unable to prove that the specific employee who performed the piercing had undergone this training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both sides presented medical evidence as to causation.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Verdict</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After deliberation, the jury found Claire&#x2019;s 75% responsible for the daughter&#x2019;s damages and responsible for an award of $69,740. As you might imagine, Claire&#x2019;s pointed to the release signed by the mother and filed a motion for reimbursement from the mother to the tune of $200,000, including the defense costs, attorney&#x2019;s fees and judgment. Unfortunately for the mother, the judge agreed that she was responsible to pay, based upon the release she signed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother appealed this judgment, however, claiming the agreement violated Florida&#x2019;s public policy. The case ended up at the Fourth District Court of Appeal, who concluded that any indemnity agreement that forced a parent to indemnify the provider of a commercial activity for their child&#x2019;s injury due to the negligence of the provider is invalid. The court statement stated:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This indemnification agreement between a commercial activity provider and a parent, requiring the parent to indemnify the commercial entity for its own negligence when the commercial provider injures the child of the parent, is invalid. &#xA0;Such an onerous provision conflicts with the public policy expressed in </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirton v. Fields, 997 So.2d 349 (Fla.2018)</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that requires the state &#x201C;to assert its role under paren patriae to protect the interests of the minor children&#x201D; where a parent&#x2019;s release, or in this case indemnity, would impact a child&#x2019;s well-being and leave a parent with the prospects of bearing the financial burden caused by the negligence of the activity provider, thus protecting only that provider&#x2019;s interest and not the overall welfare of the child. &#xA0;It also conflicts with the public policy pronouncements of both </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ard v. Ard, 414 So.2d 1066 (Fla.1982) and Joseph v. Quest, 414 So.2d 1063 (Fla.1982).</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting the family unit is a significant public policy behind parental immunity. &#xA0;We are greatly concerned by any intrusion that might adversely affect the family relationship. &#xA0;Litigation between family members would be such an intrusion.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you, a family member or your child are unfortunately injured after signing a type of &#x201C;waiver of liability&#x201D; agreement, please contact our </span><a href="http://whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/personal-injury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal injury attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today to get the help you need. &#xA0;We would be happy to review the facts of the case as well as the language contained in the &#x201C;waiver&#x201D; for possible representation.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Central Floridians will give out-of-towners a stern warning before they venture off to our theme parks and shopping centers without an umbrella or rain poncho. What vacationers and visitors often do not realize is that sunny skies in the morning can quickly, often violently, turn into torrential afternoon downpours. Flooding, wind damage and even lightning damage can be real dangers on any given day once we get into the cycle of nearly daily thunderstorms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though annoying to many a waterlogged tourist, what makes matters worse for visitors and locals alike is the fact that getting from point A to B requires a car more often than not. Unlike cities more densely designed, Orlando and its suburbs are a wide sprawl of neighborhoods and attractions. With that in mind, we have compiled a list of safe driving tips to ensure that if you are caught in a bad storm, you can navigate through it without putting yourself, your passengers or others on the road at risk.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 Safe Driving Tips to Weather Bad Weather</span></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Prepare:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The best way to avoid dangers when driving in bad weather is to prepare before even getting on the road to begin with. Check the weather forecasts, see what times are looking most likely to have rough weather and plan your day accordingly. Also, do your due diligence to ensure that your car is ready for wet roads and heavy rain by replacing old windshield wiper blades, checking your tire pressure and tire wear, making sure all lights are in working order and that your brakes are in optimal shape. All of these features help prevent accidents in poor weather.</span></span>&#xA0;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Give More Room:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wet conditions mean slicker roads, which mean slower stops. Though you may ordinarily give a full car length or more in ordinary conditions, it&#x2019;s advisable to give double that amount or more to account for wet roads and the potential for unexpected stops. Between the danger of skidding out of control and reduced visibility, the extra space is a must.</span></span>&#xA0;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Wipers, Lights and Turn Signals:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When the rain starts, turn on your windshield wipers and lights as soon as possible. With lowered visibility, your headlights allow other motorists to see your vehicle even in the heaviest of downpours. The same can be said for turn signals, which should be used often and early to give other motorists early warning of your intended lane shifts. Note that you should not use your high beams/flashers, as they can actually further obscure your visibility and blind oncoming drivers.</span></span>&#xA0;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Slow and Steady:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Though you may be in a hurry to get off the road and out of the poor weather, that is not an excuse to speed or drive recklessly. Always keep both hands on your steering wheel and slow your speed to avoid </span><a href="http://www.safemotorist.com/articles/hydroplaning_basics.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hydroplaning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and counteract the effect of strong wind gusts. You also never know if another motorist will fail to turn on their headlights, signal or give proper time to come to a safe stop, so defensive, safe driving is a must.</span></span>&#xA0;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>When in Doubt, Pull Over: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the weather gets too intense to handle, do not take an unnecessary risk. Simply pull into the nearest parking lot or, in an emergency, onto the side of the road with your hazard lights on to ride out the storm. There are times when, even with lights on and wipers at their fastest setting, visibility is nearly zero. Never put yourself or others in danger just because you would rather not wait for the storm to blow over.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By preparing before your trip, allowing more room between yourself and other vehicles, using wipers, lights and turn signals, driving slow and steady, and pulling over if conditions get too dangerous, you can stay safe when the weather takes a turn for the worse. The truth is, you cannot know with any certainty that everyone will be following these safe driving tips, but if you take it upon yourself to drive responsibly during storms, you can make the roadway a safer place. Oh, and do not forget that umbrella&#x2013;we all know you never know when you may need it.</span></p>

TITLE: 4 Ways to Safely Share the Highway with Semi Trucks

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3203 size-full" src="http://www.whdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/traffic-3141926_1280.jpg" alt="semi truck " width="1280" height="853" srcset="http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/traffic-3141926_1280.jpg 1280w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/traffic-3141926_1280-450x300.jpg 450w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/traffic-3141926_1280-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/traffic-3141926_1280-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></span></p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hitting the highway is almost an American pastime, alongside hot dogs and baseball. We tie memories of road trips with hitting the open road and the many branching interstates that span from coast to coast. Though there are many positive memories associated with highways, there are also notable risks with the often high speeds and unpredictable traffic encountered on most highways systems across the country&#x2013;one such risk is sharing the road with semi trucks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semi trucks are the lifeblood of shipping, bolstering both online and retail shopping by getting product from point A to B in a hurry. Simply stated, semi trucks and their talented drivers are an integral asset to our economy. However, they also pose a risk to drivers in a few substantial ways that every driver should understand before hitting the highways. </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Safely Share the Highway with Semi Trucks</span></h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Be Mindful of Blind Spots:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every vehicle has blind spot areas that all drivers should be conscious of when on the road. That being understood, realize that you can help lower the chance of a semi truck driver not seeing you by avoiding their blind spots. These trucks are behemoths of the road, which make their blind spots much larger than most other vehicles. The top danger zones when sharing the road with semi trucks is directly behind their trailers, near the driver&#x2019;s side door, just behind the passenger&#x2019;s side of the vehicle and directly in front of the truck. If you steer clear of these areas of the truck, you and the driver can cruise with confidence. &#xA0;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<p></p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Drive Carefully and Deliberately:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Erratic driving, speeding and swerving in and out of lanes is dangerous around other cars. That danger is multiplied when driving negligently around semi trucks that take far longer that cars to maneuver out of danger. When sharing the highway with semi trucks, never forget to use turn signals early and often, never swerve across lanes and avoid speeding and sudden stops.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<p></p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Distraction Can Be Deadly:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We often preach the importance of driving without distractions but that is especially true when on highways with semi trucks. Unforeseen dangers like tire blowouts, erratic fellow motorists and strong gusts of wind could lead to a truck suddenly stopping or being forced to swerve. If your focus is on your radio, cell phone or fast food instead of the road, you are an accident waiting to happen. Always keep your hand on the steering wheel and eyes on the road.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<p></p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Always Pass On the Left:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As mentioned at our bullet on blind spots, semi trucks have quite a few blind spots. However, as the passenger is sitting on the left side of the vehicle (at least in America), there is far less of a blind spot on the left side of the truck. Therefore, if you are going to pass a truck, be sure to do so on the left, utilizing your turn signal and checking your own blind spot before moving into the passing lane. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semi truck drivers hold a lot of responsibility for safe driving when behind the wheel, including making mandatory breaks for sleep, never texting and driving and following the rules of the road. Though they may be safe and professional drivers, not everyone who shares the highways with them are quite as responsible. In order to safeguard all motorists, do your part by avoiding blind spots, driving carefully, avoiding distractions and always passing semi trucks on the left. For more information and data on sharing the road with semi trucks, review this helpful infographic from </span><a href="https://visual.ly/community/infographic/transportation/10-tips-sharing-road-trucks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visually</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Together, we can keep the pastime of highway driving a positive and positively safe one.</span></p>

<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-driving cars allow drivers to take a metaphorical back seat to built-in tech that uses real-time roadway analyses and sensors to safely get passengers from point A to point B without the human flaws of tiredness, distraction or inebriation. They are also not available to the public. But wait, Teslas come with self-driving technology, do they not?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The simple answer is, no. What some assume are &#x201C;self-driving cars&#x201D; are actually driver-assisted vehicles. Though a subtle, seemingly insignificant difference in verbiage, this means that the act of driving still requires that you pay attention to the road. Without doing some research or getting behind the wheel of a vehicle with such technology yourself, you would be forgiven for assuming these cars were fully autonomous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These assumptions, however, are bleeding into our world of personal injury in significant and unfortunate ways. Even going beyond false assumptions about the abilities of today&#x2019;s partially self-driving cars, drivers of these vehicles can easily fall into bad habits of only watching the road with one eye open (if at all)&#x2013;just look to the recent and tragic pedestrian death linked to an </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-uber-robot-car-could-have-missed-seeing-the-pedestrian-1521735245" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber self-driving car</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Despite the impressive abilities of these cars, we are years off from being able to catch up on our favorite Netflix television series or get in a few more precious minutes of shut-eye on our daily commute to the office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also cannot safely drink alcohol and trust our car to act as our designated driver. It seems that is exactly what one man out of San Francisco attempted to do, getting behind the wheel of his Tesla Model S with blood alcohol content at two times the legal limit. Luckily, he did not harm himself or others but was instead apprehended while asleep at the wheel on the famous Bay Bridge. His excuse? The car was on &#x201C;Autopilot.&#x201D; The California Highway Patrol surely taught him a lesson that night as he was carted off to jail and his Tesla was towed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this false sense of safety perpetuated by the vehicle, or simply assumed by the driver? In the case of the Tesla, these vehicles have a warning before the vehicle can engage its Autopilot mode for the first time that blatantly states that drivers must remain fully attentive and keep their hands on the wheel at all times. To further push the point, the owner&#x2019;s manual reiterates that the &#x201C;Autosteer&#x201D; technology will not navigate around objects partially or completely in the driving lane. Better yet, if you decide to crack open the morning newspaper as you cruise down the highway, the Tesla Model S will beep at you and eventually slow to a stop if you do not place your hands back onto the steering wheel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though these warnings and safety nets certainly help, it is also the responsibility of the driver to be informed about the vehicle they are driving and technology they are utilizing, especially considering being willfully ignorant about self-driving cars could result in the injury or death of others on the road. Understand that even with today&#x2019;s best autonomous technology, you are still responsible for your actions behind the wheel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the future of self-driving cars and the law, though no laws have been passed that directly address fully autonomous vehicles, they will be necessary soon. Until both the tech and the law advance to a point that the driver is absolved of responsibility behind the wheel, we firmly suggest you keep your eyes on the road, both hands on the steering wheel and continue to never drink and drive. Drive safely for yourself and those you share the road with every day. </span></p>

<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commuters, delivery drivers and stay-at-home parents who need to get from point A to point B in a hurry probably know the headaches that come with pothole damage. One could be going through their mental checklist while sipping their first coffee of the day when </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BANG</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an unseen pothole breaks their calm morning and feels like a sledgehammer to their tires. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we go over what can be done in the moments after hitting a pothole, let us take a look at how they are formed in the first place. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are potholes formed?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our modern roadways are built tough but are far from indestructible. The main culprits that our roadways face are water and heat, both of which, Florida has in spades. Though our friends to the north can also blame freezing temperatures, for the Sunshine State, the water that lies just below the roadways, along with extreme heat, can cause cracking. Once cracking has begun, the wear and tear from roadway use and the elements can quickly expand the crack into a gaping hole that can easily cause pothole damage to vehicles or lead drivers to dangerously swerve to avoid the hazard or brake unexpectedly. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What should you do if you see a pothole or your vehicle is damaged?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are on your commute and spot a potentially dangerous pothole, report it as soon as possible. There is a handy website called </span><a href="https://asphalt365.com/report-pothole-florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asphalt 365</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that has collected the department phone numbers of cities and counties for easy reference as soon as you have stopped your motor vehicle. Reporting a pothole can go a long way in helping others avoid costly repairs and possibly dangerous driving conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you are the victim of an unseen pothole that results in damage to your vehicle, is there anything you can do to cover repairs? Is it not the responsibility of the city or county to maintain their roadways? Well, unfortunately, fighting for the cost of pothole damage can be a challenge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one case reported by </span><a href="http://www.wftv.com/news/local/what-happens-if-you-hit-pothole-damaging-your-vehi/31998477" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WFTV</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a man out of Orange County, Florida hit a pothole on Pioneer Road, a high-traffic side street off of Silver Star Road, resulting in $600 of damages to his rim and tire. When attempting to get Orange County to provide compensation for repairs, he was surprised to find that the county was not legally responsible for damages based on one critical fact in this case: they simply claimed to be unaware of the pothole at the time of the incident, releasing them from liability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As seemingly unfair as this may seem, unless the county can be proven to have known of roadway damage and done nothing, chances are you will have to foot the bill for pothole damage. This is why reporting a pothole as soon as possible is so incredibly important for every motorist to do. If we all report potholes before they become gapingly dangerous, we may help our fellow drivers (and ourselves) avoid a lot of headaches in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you believe that your accident or car damage was caused by the negligence of others (even the county or state), please contact an attorney who specializes in </span><a href="http://whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/auto-accidents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">car accident</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> litigation before giving up on your case. We understand how difficult it can be to determine whether or not to move forward in seeking compensation, but it is well worth asking an expert. Drive safe and may your commutes, afternoon drives or delivery routes remain pothole-free.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 9-18, <a href="http://officialbikeweek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bike Week</a> will officially be roaring into Daytona Beach. As the name suggests, there will be thousands of motorcycles on our roads as thousands make their way to the festivities. We have all see the signs and bumper stickers that say, &#x201C;Look Twice Save A Life,&#x201D; which is absolutely life-saving advice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one of our motorcycle accident cases, one expert told me that most drivers subconsciously look for two headlights when checking for oncoming traffic, which causes many motorcycle accidents. About half of fatal motorcycle crashes result from a car or truck colliding with it, often because drivers simply do not see it or misjudge how close it is and how fast it is traveling. The smaller size of motorcycles compared to other vehicles on the road means they can appear to be farther away than they are, and it is easy to misjudge their speed. The combination of congested roadways, distracted driving, and the difficulty of seeing motorcycles in traffic has led to far too many preventable fatalities each year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most motorcycle crashes are caused by drivers who pull out in front of motorcycles. The motorcyclist may not have time to stop or avoid the crash. Note that motorcycles take about 1.75 times the distance to stop as a car because there is less friction between the tires and the road than in a car or truck. The news has covered several recent motorcycles-versus-car crashes, and the motorcyclists often suffered severe head injuries. Even with the prevalence of head injuries, Florida does not require motorcyclists to wear helmets.&#xA0;However, if you are not going to wear a helmet, you are required to carry more insurance to cover medical expenses. There are special laws and insurance issues that apply to motorcycle claims that we can answer for you. </span></p>
<p><b>What are some driving tips for safely sharing the road with motorcycles?</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look twice for motorcycles, especially at intersections.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obey posted speed limits.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use your turn signals and check your blind spots before changing lanes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#x2019;t follow a motorcycle too closely.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always assume motorcycles are closer than they appear to be.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give motorcyclists a full lane.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all need to be more careful and look twice to save a life every day, but especially with the coming influx of motorcycles due to Bike Week.&#xA0;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A first-time customer walked into a store and slipped and fell on a liquid substance resulting in a knee injury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customer sued the store alleging negligence on the part of the store for failing to maintain reasonably safe conditions therein. The store&#x2019;s attorney moved for summary judgment arguing to the Court that the store cannot be negligent because the store and their employees did not have knowledge of the liquid substance on the floor prior to the fall. The judge agreed and granted the store&#x2019;s motion for summary judgment. By granting the summary judgment, the case could not proceed any further and could not go to trial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the appellate court agreed with the judge&#x2019;s ruling, which put an end to the entire case brought by the innocent and injured customer.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the customer to prevail, the customer must prove:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The store owed a legal duty to the customer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The store breached the duty owed to the customer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a causal connection between the store&#x2019;s breach of duty and the customer&#x2019;s knee injury.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customer sustained injuries/damages caused by the store&#x2019;s breach.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court essentially took issue with element (2) as the customer testified in deposition that she did not see the liquid on the floor prior to the fall, she did not see any employees in the area of the liquid prior to the fall, she did not know what the liquid was and didn&#x2019;t know how long it had been there. In addition, it was not raining at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the testimony, the court found that the store did not have actual notice, meaning that there was a lack of evidence that the store knew the liquid was there, or constructive knowledge, meaning there was a lack of evidence that they should have known liquid was on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court relied on </span><a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0700-0799/0768/Sections/0768.0755.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida Statute Section 768.0755</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which states:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1) If a person slips and falls on a transitory foreign substance in a business establishment, the injured person must prove that the business establishment had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition and should have taken action to remedy it. Constructive knowledge may be proven by circumstantial evidence showing that:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a) The dangerous condition existed for such a length of time that, in the exercise of ordinary care, the business establishment should have known of the condition; or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(b) The condition occurred with regularity and was therefore foreseeable.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is completely understandable that if you fall in a place of business and suffer an injury that the only thing on your mind is to get medical care, or if you don&#x2019;t feel any pain, simply to get up as soon as possible and shrug it off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this case and the law in Florida places the burden on the customer, so if possible, it is always a good idea to take photographs or have someone with you take photographs. Also, keep your clothing that may contain the liquid and listen closely to what the employees say upon their arrival. We have had many cases where our clients overheard an employee saying something like &#x201C;I told them to clean it up earlier,&#x201D; or &#x201C;the substance has been there for 25 minutes&#x201D; or &#x201C;the substance came from a leaking box a customer took out 15 minutes ago.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We represent clients that have been seriously injured in slip and fall incidents. Although Florida law can be challenging, experienced </span><a href="https://www.whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/personal-injury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal injury attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can put forth the required evidence to win your case and obtain fair and adequate justice.</span></p>

<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida sometimes gets a bad wrap. From people who claim the state has little value outside of the theme parks to those who suggest the strangest behavior seems to culminate here, at times it can feel a bit like the Sunshine State spends an unfair amount of time as the butt of jokes. Unfortunately, the following story does not help this stereotype. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a story by the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/11/04/a-florida-woman-rode-her-horse-on-a-highway-drunk-she-was-charged-with-a-dui/?utm_term=.ef0087a7b74c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Polk County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office arrested a woman for riding her horse on a busy highway while under the influence of alcohol. A passerby noticed the woman looking distressed and confused and reported her to the police, who quickly took her into custody after she was found two times over the legal limit. However, this arrest has some experts skeptical as to whether it was justified according to Florida&#x2019;s DUI laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us break down a few quick facts about what constitutes drinking and driving in the state of Florida so you can weigh in on this case.</span></p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>

<li><b>The Legal Limit: <span style="font-weight: 400;">In Florida, a driver&#x2019;s blood alcohol limit is .08 if they are at or over the legal drinking age of 21 years old. Drivers under 21 face a zero-tolerance policy if stopped with a blood alcohol level of .02, facing an automatic license suspension of six months. In the case of the intoxicated woman on horseback, she was clearly over the legal limit based on her reported stumbling, the smell of alcohol on her breath and her breathalyzer results.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vehicles:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Though rules on what constitutes a vehicle vary from state to state, an easy rule of thumb is that if it is supposed to be driven, ridden or operated on roadways or has an engine, it counts. This includes cars, trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, bicycles, and even lawn mowers and golf carts. Now, some would argue that a horse is a vehicle, especially when ridden on a roadway, but others point to a law that states that horseback riders are to be treated as pedestrians. This is an ambiguous factor in the case.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">For first-time DUI offenders, consequences include a fine up to $500, 50 hours of community service, up to a year of probation, up to six months in jail, license revocation for at least 180 days and 12 hours of DUI school. If the offense includes a minor in the vehicle, up to 9 months of jail time can be sentenced. If the DUI involves an accident that destroys property, injures others or leads to death, the punishments only become more severe. This conviction stays on a person&#x2019;s driving record for 75 years&#x2013;essentially, for life. It is unclear in the article whether this was the woman&#x2019;s first conviction.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida&#x2019;s DUI laws mostly go along with the standards seen across the U.S., which is to say they are as severe as the crime they punish. If you decide to drink and drive, you also willfully choose to not only negligently put your life and the lives of your passengers in grave danger, but also risk the lives of all others on the road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case we open this blog with, the lines are a bit blurred. The woman put her life, her horse&#x2019;s life and the lives of motorists at risks the day she decided to overindulge and hit the road. However, is her crime, under Florida&#x2019;s DUI laws, punishable as a DUI? Given the aforementioned statute that dictates horseback riders be treated as pedestrians, probably not. However, her actions were still negligent and she should think twice before taking a ride after hitting the bar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for those of us who stick to more traditional vehicles, always decide how you will get home safely before you consume alcohol. Whether it is electing a designated sober driver, arranging a cab or utilizing a ride-sharing app, there are plenty of ways to not only enjoy adult beverages but also get home safely at the end of the night. Be safe, be smart and never drink and drive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Florida, we all look forward to the change of temperature, no matter how small or brief the break from heat and humidity may be. When the weather cools, many take the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors by riding bikes, hosting cookouts, walking and running or just sitting and enjoying the milder weather.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those activities, riding a bicycle has to be one of the most popular. If you decide to ride your bike (which is considered a vehicle and must follow the rules of the road), always remember to wear a helmet. Brain injuries are the number one killer and/or disabler of children in America. Helmets are 85% effective in protecting against brain injury. Though you may have a false sense of safety if you are a cautious cyclist, Florida has the highest rate in the nation for injury and deaths in bicycle accidents. It is never worth the risk when you could simply wear a helmet and increase your chances of walking away from an accident.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helmet Fitting Tips</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Measure your head:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Measure just above your eyebrows. Place the helmet on your head and see if it has too much wiggle room when you move. Your helmet should fit low, level and snug.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Adjust the fit:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With most helmets, you can adjust the fit with removable pads. Rock the helmet gently from side to side and front to back&#x2013;it should not move. Next, look in a mirror. Your helmet should sit level on your head and cover most of your forehead.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Adjust the straps:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Adjust the front, rear and chin straps to make the helmet level and snug. The front and back straps should make a &#x201C;V&#x201D; that comes together just under the ear. Buckle the strap securely.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Test the helmet for fit:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There should be little movement when your head is shaken. &#xA0;The straps should feel tight but not too tight. You should be able to slide your finger under the inside edge of the helmet. Remember to double check the fit of your helmet every time you ride.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustments need to be made due to hairstyles and hair lengths, as well as the gradual growth of a child. Be sure to replace your helmet if it becomes too small or if it sustains damage. Try to store your helmet out of the hot sun, which could break down the glue keeping it together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before purchasing a helmet, be sure to look inside for a sticker that indicates it meets the </span><a href="http://www.smf.org/helmetguide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and/or DOT standards. If you, a friend or a loved one, unfortunately, suffers personal injuries, or should you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact Wieland Hilado &amp; DeLattre, P.A. at (407) 841-7699. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a special time of year just between the sweltering summer months and winter&#x2019;s cold that marks the beginning of holiday season and the last leg of the year. As Floridians, some of us may be a bit envious of the color-changing leaves and brisk air that usually does not hit much of our state until December. However, there are many people that travel far and wide to visit family and friends in parts of the country that do enjoy a more noticeable transition into the fall. Though some fly to their destination, countless others take to a time-honored American tradition and make it a road trip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you and your loved ones are hitting the road this fall, make sure you know a few driving safety tips for the fall season.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fall Driving Safety Tips You Need to Know Before Your Road Trip</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b><b><b>Maintenance Check and Tune-Up: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Before hitting the road, make sure that your vehicle is tip-top. Common precautions include an oil change, tire rotation and check, spare tire air pressure check, light bulb check, and brake check. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these can be knocked out by simply scheduling a full tune-up at your dealership or local mechanic shop. Ensuring that these individual parts are in working order can ensure that your car not only makes it the distance you plan on traveling but also can do so safely. There is little worse than being mid-drive and having to make an emergency stop to get roadside assistance. Prepare today for an easier trip tomorrow.<p></p>
</span></b></b></b><p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p></li>
<li><strong>Watch for Leaves:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, though we may not get much in the form of autumn leaves, many of our neighbors enjoy a more traditional fall in the form of falling foliage. Though beautiful to be sure, these leaves can pose big risks to motorists if especially dense on the road. Leaves are surprisingly slick when piled, so be cautious when driving over them, especially at higher speeds and in turns.
<p></p></span></li>
<li><strong>Losing Light:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not forget that it gets darker more quickly in the fall months. Especially if driving for multiple consecutive hours, consider switching drivers or finding a hotel to stay in overnight once darkness falls. Nighttime driving can be risky, especially on roadways you are unfamiliar with and at the higher speeds common on most highways.
<p></p></span></li>
<li><strong>Seatbelts Are Mandatory:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In a car accident, the sudden stop your body must make could be powerful enough to eject you or others from your vehicle. Though airbags save lives, they are far less effective if not paired with a seatbelt. If seatbelts make you uncomfortable, adjust yours until it fits you properly but never risk your life by driving without one fastened.
<p></p></span></li>
<li><strong>Drinking and Driving is Unacceptable:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Though fall is the start of the holiday season, it is not an excuse to have one too many alcoholic beverages before hitting the road. Police are in full force on the holidays, so understand that you are not just putting yourself and others at a much higher risk for an accident but are also risking your freedom. Drinking and driving, especially with minors, can lead to serious jail time and fines. Never drink and drive. No excuses.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though some of these driving safety tips are specific to the fall, many of them can be applied to any road trip you make. By getting a tune up, watching for fallen leaves, remembering the shorter hours of sunlight, staying buckled up and never drinking and driving, you and your loved ones can hopefully make your autumn road trip a safe one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some, the first things that immediately come to mind when thinking about Florida are beaches, oranges, and amusement parks. Sure, all three of these are iconic facets to Florida&#x2019;s history and status as a tourism icon for the U.S., but only one predominantly features high-octane thrill rides and mechanical behemoths that require constant monitoring and maintenance to safely operate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amusement parks and water parks can be great fun for the entire family. Often on the cutting edge of technology, these parks spend years and countless dollars developing new ways to entertain and thrill, but all with safety as a priority. It&#x2019;s a tightrope to walk, however. You think of what makes an exciting thrill ride and it is primarily the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">illusion </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of danger. The question is, are amusement parks historically as safe as we would like to believe or are they hiding a plethora of potential dangers around every queue?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dangers of Amusement Parks</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though fun on most occasions, amusement parks and water parks can hold certain dangers for those who do not follow safety precautions or those unfortunate enough to fall victim to the negligence of others. Such accidents include:</span></p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Slip and Fall: <span style="font-weight: 400;">An extremely common risk in notoriously temperamental Central Florida weather, an afternoon shower, morning mist or splash from a water ride is all it takes to make a walkway dangerously slick. In wet conditions, walk carefully and always wear non-slip footwear to avoid injury.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ride Malfunction:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If an attraction has not been properly examined or maintained, a ride malfunction is possible. Amusement parks must do their due diligence to ensure that all rides are safely operational, as well as operated safely, before letting guests on.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unsafe Food:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">From kiosks to street carts to full-fledged restaurants, there are plenty of food options in amusement parks. If these foods are handled without high sanitary standards or are undercooked, they may leave guests ill.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heatstroke:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida&#x2019;s heat and humidity can be absolutely suffocating in the summer months. Children and the elderly can easily succumb to heat stroke or exhaustion if exposed to the sun for too long and not given time to rehydrate. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ignoring the Rules:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Amusement parks and water parks typically post cautionary signs in front of every attraction. These signs often include warnings for those with heart, back and neck problems, epilepsy and other pre-existing conditions that could easily lead to further injury or death. The same goes for going beyond barriers, into staff areas and other off-limits sections of the park. &#xA0;It is extremely important to not ignore the rules/signs posted.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are Amusement Parks and Water Parks Doing Enough?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, in nearly everything we do, there is a risk of injury or death. Minimizing that risk, however, is primarily the responsibility of the amusement park when you and your family visit one of these attractions. Of course, this does not mean they are solely responsible, as you have a personal duty to obey all posted safety signs and warnings, as well as never act in a manner that is obviously reckless for yourself or others. Barring those exceptions of personal negligence, do amusement parks do enough to protect their visitors?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the strict standards promoted by the </span><a href="http://www.iaapa.org/safety-and-advocacy/safety/amusement-ride-safety/regulations-standards" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, yes, by and large, amusement parks do a great job of keeping their gargantuan number of annual guests safe. Maintenance, operational safety and other key considerations are the top priority. That being said, it is important to note that mistakes can (and do) still happen. When they do, far too often we never find out about them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Florida, amusement parks only have to publicly report injuries if they immediately require a 24-hour stay at a hospital, or involve a death. That means countless sprains, strains, scratches, bumps and bruises were never made public. Perhaps even more serious injuries slipped through the cracks thanks to this loophole that gives amusement parks a bit of an unfair advantage when it comes to knowing a park&#x2019;s safety track record. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though accidents are sometimes unavoidable, amusement parks should be places you can feel safe bringing your loved ones to for a day of family fun. Though most major parks have admirable safety standards, you should review </span><a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-database-florida-theme-park-injuries-deaths-20160812-htmlstory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual injury and death reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and stay informed on news regarding specific parks&#x2019; reported incidents. Also, as always, never ignore posted safety warnings or travel beyond designated guest areas. Doing either unnecessarily puts your life at risk and could lead to anything but a family fun day at the park. &#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the attorneys at Wieland, Hilado &amp; DeLattre have handled and continue to handle injury claims against the major theme parks and water parks. &#xA0;If you, a loved one, or a friend have any questions regarding a potential claim, give us a call at (407) 841-7699. &#xA0;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurricane Irma is bearing down on Florida, with current projections showing it knocking right on our front door. Even with the latest meteorological tech in our corner, it is still hard to know just how much this storm will affect us in Central Florida. Even so, as we collect water, store our non-perishables and prepare to reinforce our homes, please be sure to collect the following emergency phone numbers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency Phone Numbers and Information</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>FEMA: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">1-800-462-7585</span></li>
<li><b>National Flood Insurance:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1-888-379-9531</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure that you also have the contact information of loved ones physically written down in the case that your phone&#x2019;s battery dies or your phone is damaged. The same goes for the numbers provided above. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the wait-and-see aspect of hurricanes can be nerve wracking, remain calm, stay informed and prepare as much as possible before the storm hits. This is not Florida&#x2019;s first, and surely will not be its last, run in with a major storm like Hurricane Irma. Though we hope for minimal impact, we must also take Irma&#x2019;s threat seriously and prepare for whatever may come. Stay safe, Central Florida. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing more precious to a parent than his or her child, and it is a parent&#x2019;s primary responsibility to ensure their safety and well being. When a parent fails to do so through negligence or lack of forethought or care, tragedy can often follow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such example of child endangerment is one we see far too often in Florida &#x2014; leaving a child in a hot car. At one time, leaving a child unattended in a car while food shopping or stopping at the post office was not a rare occurrence but is now largely seen as an act of neglect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of past standards, it has come to light just how dangerous and reckless it is to leave a child unattended in a hot vehicle for any amount of time. Let us break down these dangers to illustrate just why you should never leave your child in your car, even if it is just for a few minutes.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dangers of a Leaving a Child Unattended in a Hot Car</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Green Houses on Wheels: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the temperature outside of the vehicle may feel manageable, a car acts as a greenhouse, growing hotter by the second as the sun&#x2019;s rays enter through the windows. A car&#x2019;s temperature can rise by almost 20 degrees in just 10 minutes.</span></span></li>
<li><b><b>Kids Heat Faster: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike fully grown adults, children have a <a href="http://www.parenting.com/health-guide/first-aid/heat-exhaustionheat-stroke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited ability to cool themselves</a> and generally run warmer relative to their size. This makes children far more susceptible to overheating and falling victim to heat stroke.</span></b></b></li>
<li><strong>Unsecured:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Some parents try to keep their child safe by keeping the air conditioning on while they step into the grocery store or pick up their dry cleaning. However, though doing so ensures that heat is no longer an issue, it opens you up to another list of potential threats. Children may be able to get out of seat belt restraints, lock or unlock doors, and even pop the transmission into neutral or drive. Also, an open, idling car is a prime target for an easy auto theft.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From extreme heat paired with a child&#x2019;s limited ability to regulate body temperature to the number of ways leaving your car running can be extremely dangerous, leaving your child in a car for just a few minutes can have tragic results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But sometimes, parents and caregivers can accidentally leave a child unattended in a car. Though you may not understand how such a mistake can happen, time has proven that it is not a rare occurrence. If you are driving with children, especially those strapped into a car seat behind the driver&#x2019;s seat, leave a reminder in the front seat (the child&#x2019;s toy, for example) or simply put something you will have to get before leaving the vehicle (house keys, briefcase, etc.) in order to lessen the chances that such a tragedy strikes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have explained why leaving a child in a car for any amount of time is dangerous, what does the law have to say about the matter? Despite the risks of this obvious child endangerment, it is legal in Florida for a child under the age of six to be left unsupervised inside a vehicle for up to 15 minutes. This includes if the vehicle is shut off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though lawmakers are pushing to close this dangerous loophole, as it stands, it is up to parents and those who see children in danger to keep our kids safe. If you see a child in distress while locked in an unoccupied vehicle, call the police and allow them to handle the situation safely. Together, we can help curb reckless child endangerment by keeping kids out of hot, unoccupied cars. &#xA0;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Floridians get to enjoy summer fun for most of the year, there&#x2019;s nothing like spending the months of June to September at the beaches, by a pool or at an amusement park. Unfortunately, many of these fun activities can lead to personal injuries if you or your loved ones leave safety on the back burner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that with a little education, preparation and common sense, you and yours can avoid injuries while enjoying the last month of summer.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Avoid Injuries in the Summer Season</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Swim, Slip, Fall:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> From water parks to a backyard pool, cooling off with a swim can be good fun for everyone when the hot summer sun&#x2019;s dial is turned up from &#x201C;bake&#x201D; to &#x201C;broil.&#x201D; However, especially with children, there are major slip and fall risks on pool decks and any slick surfaces traversed while still damp and barefoot. Even flip-flop sandals can be risky, as many do not have slip-resistant soles and can be just as risky as going barefoot. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid injuries around the pool or water park, shop for specifically slip-resistant sandals or water socks, dry yourself as much as possible once out of the water, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">never </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">run on wet surfaces. Puddles can be hard to spot, so always be cautious and instruct your children to do the same.<p></p>
<p></p></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Boating Blunders:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Florida is full of boating opportunities for all walks of life&#x2013;from those who love kicking back and doing some freshwater fishing to those who prefer high-octane thrills of taking a motorboat on the open ocean. The issue is, many new boaters do not fully understand the dangers of navigating unfamiliar waters, especially if operating at speeds in excess of the posted speed or wake limits. Operation while under the influence is also a major concern, as some boaters (mistakenly) feel safer drinking and boating than driving their car and boating. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid injuries and boating accidents while on the water by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">never </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drinking and boating, operating your boat especially carefully in unfamiliar waters and following all posted speed and wake limits. For good measure, always ensure that you and your passengers are always wearing US-Coast-Guard-approved personal floatation devices at all times and that other safety equipment, like fire extinguishers and emergency locator devices, are stowed and operational.<p></p>
<p></p></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Amusement Park Accidents: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amusement parks can be a great way to spend some fun summer family bonding time but it also comes with a few accident risks. According to </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/28/health/amusement-park-safety-data-2016/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission reported a whopping 300,000 amusement park injuries in 2016. However, that number may be larger, considering that many accidents go unreported in carnivals or traveling fairs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the risk of injury at most major theme parks, especially the safety-conscious and family-friendly parks that put Orlando on the map, is extremely rare, you can do your due diligence by checking the annual </span><a href="http://www.iaapa.org/safety-and-advocacy/safety/amusement-ride-safety/ride-safety-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) safety report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and ensure that you follow all safety warnings within the park.<p></p>
<p></p></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Weather Woes:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Though we may live in the &#x201C;Sunshine State,&#x201D; we know the reality of what Florida has in store at any given moment&#x2013;surprise summer thunderstorms. Even tourists quickly realize that a bright sun and blue skies can quickly turn sour, and fast. If safely indoors, most weather woes will pass over with limited risk, but when on the road or caught outside, it can be a different story.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If caught in a storm while on the road, turn on your headlight (but not your high beams), give other motorists more room than usual and, if conditions become too dangerous, pull over to a safe location to wait the storm out. If outside, seek immediate shelter in a business until the rough weather passes. Lightning is a real danger, especially when under a tree or wading in puddles of water, which may conduct a lightning strike. Also, look for downed power lines or debris immediately after a powerful storm in order to avoid injuries in the aftermath.<p></p>
<p></p></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Drinking and Driving:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Summer is often a time of big barbecue bashes and long nights of time spent sipping cold cocktails and catching up with good company. However, a summer party can turn tragic if you or your guests decide to get behind the wheel after a few drinks.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know that you will be consuming alcohol, make a conscious plan </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you get to the party. Designate a sober driver, make plans with the party&#x2019;s host to spend the night or simply order an Uber or Lyft to get you safely back home without putting yourself and every other motorist and pedestrian at risk.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we stated before, Florida&#x2019;s summer tends to seep into most of the months of the year, but there is nothing quite like spending June, July and August soaking up the season&#x2019;s sun by a pool, on a boat, at an amusement park or simply while enjoying some drinks with good friends and family. However, you should always keep safety as your number-one priority. After all, with safety squared away, you can have more fun knowing you are doing everything to avoid injuries and protect yourself and your family. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your car&#x2019;s engine starts sputtering, you take it to a mechanic. When you get a nasty cough, you seek the help of a physician. It makes logical sense that, if you are injured as a result of someone else&#x2019;s negligence and are seeking the compensation that is owed to you in a court of law, you would </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/how-to-choose-an-attorney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hire a personal injury lawyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, many are often unsure as to whether their best move after an accident or injury is to hire a personal injury attorney, assuming their case will be open-shut or their injuries are too minimal to require the help of a professional litigator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unfortunate truth is that many who do not hire an experienced personal injury lawyer, especially if they have no experience in law, are left receiving far less than they deserve for their pain, suffering and losses. If you are on the fence about hiring an attorney to help with your personal injury case, consider the following facts:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasons to Hire a Personal Injury Lawyer</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Legal Complications:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When dealing with an injury and the law, you are also dealing with two very technically complex fields of law. From extensive documentation to legal jargon, the vast majority of people simply do not have the knowledge base to tackle such cases and to deal with the insurance adjusters directly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Educated and Objective Opinions:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Something many do not understand unless they have been injured by the carelessness of others is that a personal injury case can run you through a gauntlet of emotions. Anger, fear, confusion and frustration are all extremely common in such cases. Many need an objective, educated opinion removed from the high emotions of the incident to be a rational decision maker. The last thing you want is to accept a settlement out of desperation, fear or frustration.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Expertise:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The most obvious benefit of hiring an experienced personal injury lawyer is receiving their expertise. Someone who knows the ropes could make the litigation experience much smoother than jumping into it with only a layman&#x2019;s knowledge of the law. Better yet, an attorney can let you know early on if your case is worth pursuing in the first place and discuss any potential; problem areas with your case.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Representation:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If it comes down to it, an experienced personal injury lawyer will fight for you in court based on a strong and viable legal strategy that is based on sound principles, practice, and years of experience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Settlement Success: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">An experienced personal injury attorney can often secure a settlement before litigation is even necessary. Most importantly, they can push for and ensure that the settlement offer covers all property damage, lost wages, pain and suffering, and not only current medical bills, but any potential future treatments necessary until you have fully recovered from your injuries. If you will never recover to the state of health you enjoyed before your injury, your settlement should reflect that substantial loss.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Insurance Company Navigation:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Make no mistake about it&#x2013;dealing with insurance companies and their adjusters can be one of the most treacherous and frustrating elements of your personal injury case. Even if they have a calm, kind demeanor, the objective of the negligent party&#x2019;s insurance company representative is to save their company money. If you hire an experienced personal injury lawyer, they can act as a watchdog, flagging inaccuracies or undervalued offers and put the pressure back on the insurance company instead of you, the victim.<br>
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Lawyer-to-Lawyer Rapport:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If your case goes to court, you will want an experienced personal injury attorney in your corner who can communicate on an equal playing field as the other party&#x2019;s lawyer.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you hire a personal injury lawyer? Though this is a question only you as the injury victim can answer, we would wholeheartedly recommend you at very least consider doing so and consult with an attorney. &#xA0;An experienced personal injury attorney is more than just a confidant, but also a watchdog, consultant and objective voice that could lead you through the complexities of personal injury law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never forget, in the days, weeks, months and years after an injury, you do not have to fight for your recovery alone. Hire an experienced personal injury lawyer and get back to the life you love.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Litigation can be a bit like chess. No, it is not a game, but it is a strategic, mentally challenging and often complex practice that requires forethought, hard work and the ability to act immediately and wisely. Each case is different, and for those who have never been injured by another in the past, it may be difficult to plan next moves. Add to the mix the confusion associated with many more serious injuries, having to deal with rehabilitation and hospital bills, making up for lost time at work and dealing with the personal stresses that sudden injuries can put on entire families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, many wonder if they should hire a personal injury lawyer who knows the rules and what each piece, from pawn to king, can do to get you the best results when seeking justice of a serious personal injury claim. Well, as each case is unique and poses its own unique challenges, it is not easy to say without understanding the circumstances of the injury. However, you and your family can pose a few important questions to yourself and make your own judgment call on hiring a competent, thorough and professional to help provide you quality representation. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it time to hire a personal injury lawyer?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before making the decision of hiring a personal injury lawyer to handle your case, make sure you ask yourself these questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>How serious are my injuries?:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not all personal injury cases are the same largely due to the fact that not all injuries are the same. From simple bumps and bruises to catastrophic, traumatic brain injuries, the seriousness of an injury must be considered. Intuitively, the more serious an injury is, the more expensive and long standing the recovery can be &#x2013; and not just in terms of financial impact (though that is certainly not to be understated), but also emotional and social losses that can be incurred. If your injuries require extended hospital stays, surgeries, rehabilitation or result in permanent damage, whether mental or physical, you should most certainly hire a personal injury lawyer to ensure you receive fair and justified compensation &#x2013; not just what the insurance company is willing to pay.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Is there a dispute?: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people try to avoid conflict at all costs. Fighting for something, even if you are in the right, can be stressful and uncomfortable. When an insurance company throws its best lawyers behind attempting to diminish your personal injury claims, it can be as frustrating as it is frightening. Even the sweetest-talking insurance representative can be hiding dubious intentions behind their placid demeanor. Do not be fooled. We recommend hiring a personal injury lawyer before speaking to anyone to ensure that your words will not be twisted, taken out of context and weaponized against your case. If there is even hint of a coming dispute, it is time for professional help. And please remember to not provide a recorded statement with an insurance representative without first consulting with an attorney.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Are you experienced in the litigation process?: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though many have never been in the position to fight for a claim or see the inside of a courtroom, some have, and can adequately hold their own. By all means, if you are a student of the law and have a deep enough understanding of what you are owed based on the law of the land, you can take on your case without professional help. However, we would still recommend the oversight that can only come from a well-practiced litigation team.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Who is at fault?:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Unfortunately, the negligence of others is often the cause of serious, even life-threatening, injuries. Whether it was a car accident caused by a distracted driver or a slip-and-fall incident caused by insufficient warning signage on a wet department store floor, you will want a team of personal injury lawyers in your corner to collect evidence and secure fault in your case.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the chess-like strategy required for your personal injury case is understanding when you are outmatched. Though a personal injury case can seem, well, personal, professional help is often needed in order to match the litigious might of big businesses and unsympathetic insurance companies. You should not be expected to have to fight for your claim alone against odds like that. Additionally, insurance companies have no qualms about rushing you to make a settlement of a claim, even while you are still recovering from the shock of injury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you do not seek the help of a lawyer immediately, we strongly recommend you acquire as much evidence at the time of the accident, seek immediate medical attention even if you believe your injuries to be minor and do not talk about the accident to anyone before you have recovered from the initial shock of the injury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Wieland Hilado &amp; DeLattre, we have a passion for helping ordinary people who have been victimized by the negligence of others. Though the choice to hire a personal injury lawyer lands squarely in your lap, we urge you to consider the aforementioned questions before taking on a claim alone. Our team is here to help and have no&#xA0;problem fighting for you, if necessary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat and other social media channels have quite literally changed the way that we interact, talk and live in our modern society. Even if you do not personally use social media, words like, well, &#x201C;like&#x201D; have taken on completely new meaning, with others, such as &#x201C;hashtag&#x201D; being invented altogether due to the world&#x2019;s fascination and reliance with social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with most of any tech that affects the public&#x2019;s day-to-day lives, social media has had a very real effect on litigation &#x2013; especially personal injury litigation. Though we have already covered some of </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/2016/05/12/how-social-media-affects-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media&#x2019;s potential risks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for personal injury cases, we feel it is a topic well worth reexamination.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dangers of Social Media for Your Personal Injury Case</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidence comes in many forms. From eyewitness testimony to medical records to photos taken at the scene, but many forget that social media can easily be used to support or fight your claim. For example, if your claim is that your car accident has left you with crippling back pain that keeps you from enjoying life as you once had, but then post a video of yourself on Instagram giving your son a piggyback ride with no issues, do not expect your claim to go far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the tricky thing is, even seemingly innocent posts can still be used against you with the right argument. Especially mental duress claims can be refuted by something as simple as your smile in a photo to a positive comment you leave on another&#x2019;s social profile. Be extra careful about anything you post as something as simple as &#x201C;I am doing okay&#x201D; can become an issue later. &#xA0;Always be cautious and realize everything you are writing, unless in a private message, can, and will, be used against you without your consent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fact &#x2013; that your social media profile (whatever is viewable to the public) is public record &#x2013; is surprising to many who assume their online privacy without ever actually checking. Do not forget that others can often &#x201C;tag&#x201D; you in social posts, even going as far as identifying you within photos and videos, so do your due diligence and ensure that neither you, nor your friends and family, are posting any content that may, in any way, harm your claim. &#xA0;Do not post anything on any social site about your accident, your injuries, your claim, your doctor or your treatment. &#xA0;Be sure not to delete anything from your current social media accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our advice when seeking compensation for damages? Set all of your social media profiles to their most strict security settings, disable the ability for friends and family to &#x201C;tag&#x201D; you within posts, and ask loved ones to refrain from posting video, photos or even text-only posts that reference you or your case until your claim can be made in a court of law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand how difficult it can be for a growing number of people to log off from social media for a prolonged period of time. However, when your Facebook activity can end up getting between you and the full compensation that you deserve, we highly recommend taking a break until your case has concluded.</span></p>

<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have lived any full year in Florida, you have the knowledge of a few things about severe weather. From temperatures that could fry an egg on asphalt to thunderstorms that sound like a pair of cymbals tumbling down an escalator, the Sunshine State is often home to some scary weather-based scenarios. Of course, like anything else, we learn to live with the tornado warnings and hurricane watches. However, even many longtime Florida residents do not know the best ways to protect their home before severe weather strikes. Far fewer know their responsibilities under premises liability if the storm causes damage to their property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is worse is that many of these storms are completely unpredictable. Though you may be able to somewhat accurately forecast the path of a hurricane, quickly developing tornadoes, dangerous wind gusts and lightning strikes leave us nearly powerless and with very little time to prepare in the face of mother nature&#x2019;s fury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, let us review a few severe weather risks that Florida poses in the summer months, as well as how you can protect yourself and your family from them.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Tornadoes:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Posing a serious risk to people and property alike, tornadoes can create winds reaching 200 mph. This is strong enough to destroy homes, throw cars through the air like toys and easily injure or kill those who do not seek shelter. During thunderstorms, keep track of news broadcasts, and if a tornado warning is issued, seek shelter immediately.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, Florida&#x2019;s soil makes it quite rare that homeowners are fortunate enough to have basements or underground shelters to seek protection from a tornado. Instead, most Floridians must find the centermost room on the bottom floor, away from windows (bathrooms or closets are commonly used for shelter). If on the road, do not attempt to outrun the tornado. They have been known to reach speeds of 70 mph and move erratically. Instead, seek shelter where you can find it, but avoid going under an overpass, as these can act as wind tunnels that actually increase wind speeds. Instead, if stranded, lay flat on the ground with your head covered.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Floods:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Florida&#x2019;s thunderstorms can come hard and fast, dumping feet of torrential rain in a matter of hours. If drainage is inadequate or rain is severe enough, water can damage homes, vehicles, and other low-lying property.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your home is at risk of flood damage, protect it by laying down sandbags to block the water from entry. Additionally, you can protect your property by investing in federal flood insurance. Though it may be tempting, never attempt to drive in flooded areas. Doing so in a vehicle not meant to handle such conditions could easily strand you. Also avoid entering the flood waters, as they may contain harmful debris, dangerous chemicals or risk of electrocution from downed power lines.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><b><b><b><b><b><b><b>Lightning: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida is the lightning capitol of the U.S. When you hear thunder, it is time to pack up the beach gear, get out of the pool and retreat from the putting green immediately. Though inconvenient for summer fun, even storms that seem at a safe distance can cause life-threatening lightning strikes that seemingly come out of thin air, so pack it in and find shelter before the storm hits. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you cannot find refuge inside a building, get inside a car and keep hands away from the exterior of the vehicle, as well as the radio and other electronics. A vehicle on rubber tires can act as a protective insulator if struck by lightning. Also, be warned that water is a conduit for electricity, so even puddles of standing water can send a dangerous surge of electricity through you if a strike even occurs nearby.</span></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></li>
<li><b>Hurricanes: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Often large, powerful and downright frightening, hurricanes can wreak destruction that takes years to fully recover from. From winds that can reach upwards of 150 mph at the most severe to the torrential rain and flooding, you do not want to underestimate the awesome power of such storms. Though many locals can become jaded by the near misses and weaker storms that have made their way to Florida in recent years, you would be wise to prepare for the worst once it becomes apparent that a hurricane is headed our way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning evacuation routes ahead of time, boarding up homes and businesses days before the storm is set to make landfall, buying water, nonperishable goods, and safety equipment before the last minute can all go a long way in preventing panic and injury once the storm hits. If time allows, consider trimming loose branches from trees and removing anything that may act as a projectile on your lawn or backyard. Always heed evacuation notices and never try to &#x201C;ride it out&#x201D; unless absolutely necessary.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Severe Weather Strikes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after making it through the above cases of severe weather unscathed, there are risks that may still pose a threat to you, your family and your neighbors. As a homeowner, you owe invited guests protection from dangerous conditions. Though on a normal day, that may mean fixing that busted step on your porch or rolling up the water hose that was dangerously strewn across your driveway, but after severe weather, dangers may be all around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for the likes of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downed trees or branches</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roof damage, including missing tiles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debris strewn across your yard and walkways</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broken glass from vehicles or your home</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live wires or electrical hazards</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing pools of water</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wild animals that may have been displaced</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are aware of potential dangers on your property caused by severe weather, it is your responsibility to identify and remove these risks. However, if you cannot repair the damage or remove the risks yourself, alert guests to the danger and immediately call a professional to report the issue. If your guest ignores your warnings and is injured as a result, you may be removed from any claims of negligence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main thing to remember before, during, and after a storm? Be safe and use common sense. If you see severe weather headed your way, take shelter, ride out the storm from a safe location and use caution during the clean up afterward. Remove the dangers on your property that you can and call in the professionals for assistance in the rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are injured due to a homeowner&#x2019;s&#xA0;neglect to protect you from harm while on their property, do not hesitate to contact our premises liability attorneys today. Stay safe, stay smart and pack an umbrella this summer.</span></p>

TITLE: Possible Big Changes for Personal Injury Lawsuits
DATE: 06/20/2017

<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3077" src="http://www.whdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/guilherme-cunha-222337-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="personal injury lawsuits" width="1024" height="683" srcset="http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/guilherme-cunha-222337-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/guilherme-cunha-222337-1-450x300.jpg 450w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/guilherme-cunha-222337-1-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/guilherme-cunha-222337-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When an American clocks in for a day of work, he or she does so with a reasonable expectation of safety. Knowing that the office building we spend up to twelve hours a day within isn&#x2019;t lined with toxic lead paint or covered in cancerous asbestos can go a long way in improving productivity, to say the least. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large bearer of responsibility for safety in the workplace is the employer, who is charged with ensuring the building, equipment and hired staff are safe. The employer is not the only liable party, however. If a coworker shows up to the steel mill still intoxicated from a night of drinking and causes an accident, he may be found directly responsible for his actions (though depending on the circumstances, the company could also face some liability). Beyond both employer and employee, however, there is an organization that&#x2019;s sole objective is to be the guardians of American workers. That group is the United States Department of Labor&#x2019;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and it may soon be facing orders to decrease enforcement.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potential Decreased Enforcement Power for OSHA</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With any deregulation to include a complete halt on news releases documenting enforcement fines would result in less accountability when it comes to workplace safety. This is significant because these releases often shamed safety violators and, thus, increased the stakes of allowing such violations to happen in the first place. Without this public scrutiny, businesses may face wrist slapping by OSHA in the safety of anonymity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to one </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/business/us-worker-safety-rules-osha.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an OSHA spokeswoman has claimed that their efforts have not been altered, yet many still fear a coming wave of deregulation&#x2013;a serious risk when OSHA enforces such key workplace responsibilities as: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining safe working standards recognized under the OSH Act and OSHA standards</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posting warning signs of potential workplace hazards</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure tools and equipment are maintained and safe to use</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing adequate training</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Openly posting the OSHA poster, which informs employees of their rights</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping record of all workplace injuries</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never discriminating against &#x201C;whistleblowers&#x201D; acting within their rights</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of other vitally important employee rights, found </span><a href="https://www.osha.gov/as/opa/worker/employer-responsibility.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Impact of OSHA Deregulation on Personal Injury Lawsuits</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though we are practiced litigators, taking a case to court is never a decision we suggest you take lightly. However, without OSHA there to hold employers responsible for upholding safety standards, many believe deregulation will lead to an increase in personal injury lawsuits. After all, if standards lower, lawyers will be the last line of defense against negligent employers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that major changes to OSHA&#x2019;s regulations would most likely take years to go into effect, so there is no immediate risk of major changes rolling through quite yet. That being said, this is a story that we&#x2019;ll be sure to keep an eye on, as should you and every employed American. &#x201C;Safety first&#x201D; should not just be a mantra for our personal lives, but our professional as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are injured in the workplace, make sure to do your due diligence by immediately reporting the injury to your employer, seeking professional medical help and ensuring that your employer notifies their insurance company. If you have any reason to believe they have not, please contact </span><a href="http://www.myfloridacfo.com/Division/wc/Employee/default.htm#.WQttZ7zysXp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida&#x2019;s Division of Workers&#x2019; Compensation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> immediately. Additionally, if you feel that your injury should have been prevented, do not hesitate to call our </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/workers-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workers&#x2019; compensation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attorneys immediately.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you get sideswiped on the way to work or get rear-ended by a distracted driver, a single incident can leave you with long-lasting pain and suffering. It only takes one accident to forever alter one&#x2019;s life. For this reason, it is important to understand what pain and suffering is defined as in the eyes of Florida law, as well as how you may be able to make such claims if you are unfortunately injured due to the negligence of others.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining Pain and Suffering</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the simplest terms, pain and suffering is exactly what you might imagine: physical or psychological injuries caused in an accident. As we all know, injuries sustained can run the gamut from cuts and bruises to the most serious of traumatic brain injuries. If your injury is serious enough that it impairs your life or has the potential to cause you long-lasting mental anguish, you may very well have a case to claim pain and suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For accidents that do cause debilitating, traumatic injuries that may impact the victim for months, years or a lifetime, claiming pain and suffering in a suit against the responsible party is justified. Remember, however, that not all scars are physical and not all injuries can be healed through sutures and bandages. Sometimes an accident is so harrowing, it can leave the victim with depression, anxiety, insomnia and other forms of very real, often debilitating mental anguish. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proving Your Case</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though you may think your pain and suffering is obvious, never pass up the opportunity to collect more evidence: every bit you can find helps. Police reports, doctors&#x2019; notes, journal entries, friends and relatives, photos and even eyewitness testimony can all be big players in proving your claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, if an accident has caused you to suffer pain and emotional distress, you can prove your symptoms in a court of law by providing a diagnosis by a trained medical professional and documenting symptoms of injuries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are involved in an accident and believe another party is responsible for your pain and suffering, please do not hesitate to contact our personal injury attorneys immediately. We are here to help you recover what you are owed after the tragedy of an accident.</span></p>

TITLE: Locked and Loaded: Gun Storage Safety and Liability
DATE: 05/04/2017

<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3069" src="http://www.whdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ammunition-2004236_1920-1024x683.jpg" alt="gun safety" width="1024" height="683" srcset="http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ammunition-2004236_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ammunition-2004236_1920-450x300.jpg 450w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ammunition-2004236_1920-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the Bill of Rights was drafted, bearing arms has been a guaranteed right for American citizens, and one that many hold dear. When any American purchases a gun for either self-protection or hunting and sporting purposes, they do so making an unspoken promise to their friends, family, neighbors and loved ones to respect the power and take on the responsibility that comes with gun ownership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though laws differ from state to state, Florida&#x2019;s gun laws are comparatively lenient and the state is an issuer of concealed carry licenses. No registration or owner license is required for a legal gun purchase and background checks are not required for private sales of both handguns or long guns (rifles and full-size shotguns). There are also no laws against assault weapons or restrictions on magazine capacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For concealed carry licenses, gun owners are required to do their due diligence by taking firearms safety courses, often available at gun ranges and gun clubs. Though these classes may review the likes of trigger discipline and properly clearing the weapon for safe handling, gun storage safety is as instrumental to overall gun ownership safety as any measure taken in the handling of the weapon.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun Storage Safety: How to Safely Store a Weapon</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few different methods of gun storage safety available to gun owners. To leave the gun in storage, gun owners should do the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unload the firearm, including clearing the chambered round</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place in a locked cabinet, gun safe, vault, storage case or other securable means not accessible to children</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep bullets safely stored, preferably in fireproof storage</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilize gun locking devices that make firing the weapon impossible</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest concern when discussing gun storage safety is keeping them out of the hands of children, who may not understand the consequences of handling a weapon. Simply placing a gun in the bottom of a dresser drawer or atop a high shelf is not enough to ensure safety; children are curious and can be much more observant than you realize. Only store weapons behind secure locks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to store a loaded weapon, you must do so realizing that you may be introducing real danger into your home. Be especially cautious if you share your home with children or people with alcohol or drug abuse issues or mental illness.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negligence and Gun Storage Safety</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, negligent gun storage came into the conversation due to a couple of </span><a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-orlando-police-ar-15-stolen-20170214-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent gun thefts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involving the Orlando Police Department. The police have now called for all officers to remove weapons from their vehicles at the end of their shifts, but what if the same happens to you? Or what if your weapon is stolen from within your home? Can you face charges if your weapon is used to commit a crime after being stolen?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it all depends on what is done with the gun after it is stolen and if it was foreseeable that the gun would be stolen. Though you may be negligent in leaving your gun unsecured, under the </span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/proximate_cause" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proximate cause</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the recklessness of the thief using your weapon in a crime supersedes the negligence of leaving the weapon unsecured. That being said, if you were to leave a loaded weapon out in the open and a child accidentally injures themselves or others, you would be held liable for those injuries. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responsibility and Firearm Ownership</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it is our right as Americans to own firearms for hunting, sporting or home defense, we must always remember to do so safely and responsibly, which includes gun storage safety. Keeping your weapon secured also has the added benefit of keeping you from possibly facing liability if a child injures themselves or others with your unsecured weapon. As always, make safety a priority.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, we may not be able to zip over to Mars for afternoon tea or take the hoverboard down to Publix to grab a gallon of milk. Despite this somewhat disappointing reality, technology has grown immensely since the science fiction novels, radio shows and movies of the 1950s began forecasting how life in the 21st century would play out for humanity. Though falling short of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jetsons</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cell phones, the internet, virtual reality and, now, autonomous cars, are real pieces of tech that promise to continue developing and evolving into inseparable appendages of modern life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the advancements made in technology, our law must also advance and update with the times. As we often deal with </span><a href="http://whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/auto-accidents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">car accident law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and driving safety, Florida&#x2019;s stance on self-driving car law is fascinating and important for us to share with the greater public, who may be asking the same questions as we were when the concept of a fully autonomous car began to look more and more possible. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are Self-Driving Cars?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those unaware about this relatively new advancement in automobiles, companies like Mercedes-Benz, GM, Tesla, Nissan and many more are putting big bucks behind the technology that would, ostensibly, make the act of driving obsolete. Utilizing GPS systems combined with sensor technology that can, in real time, recognize and react to dynamic conditions found on every roadway (unexpected stops, swerving vehicles, construction zones, etc.), self-driving cars could allow drivers to spend their commutes safely taking calls, emailing associates or surfing the web without a worry. That being said, the tech is still in the prototyping phase, with current self-driving cars still requiring drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and remain aware of their surroundings.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advancements of Florida&#x2019;s Self-Driving Car Law</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida stands as one of the most lenient states when it comes to self-driving cars. As of 2016, it is legal in the state of Florida to allow a self-driving car to operate without a human present in the vehicle&#x2013;the small caveat being that the operator must be able to be alerted in case of vehicle failure. No special permits are required for owning and operating self-driving cars, which is great news for companies like Uber that see autonomous cars as a potentially bright future for driver-free taxi services. The impact on Florida&#x2019;s drivers? Well, that is where the debate is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many who oppose Florida&#x2019;s laid-back approach to self-driving car law purport that the lack of regulation puts all of us at risk. For comparison, other states require that the vehicle is operated only for testing purposes only, or simply have not adopted a stance on the subject at all yet. Though driverless car operators are currently still required to have a valid driver&#x2019;s license, that may change with the definition of &#x201C;operator.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If, in the future, self-driving cars become proficient (and safe) enough to truly utilize to their full potential, a driver&#x2019;s license may no longer be necessary, as the operator will, technically, be the vehicle itself. Just as passively as one boards a subway car or commuter bus, so could we someday be driven to work by our own vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this being said, we are not at that point yet. In fact, Florida was the location of the </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/2016/07/19/whos-blame-tesla-faces-first-death-associated-autopilot-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first reported self-driving car death</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which involved Telsa&#x2019;s Autopilot system. As we alluded to before, this system, in particular, makes it known that it is in its &#x201C;beta testing&#x201D; phase and that drivers must still work as a failsafe for the self-driving tech.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future and Safety</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These updates to self-driving car law, which removed the need for an in-car operator among other things, seems to have been made with monetary interests top of mind. It may be cynical to view these leniencies in this manner, but when a </span><a href="http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/dec/28/jeff-brandes/florida-no-permit-needed-driverless-cars-florida-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state Senator openly courts Uber on Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is hard to see it as anything but a business investment. Our stance is always with safety as the primary concern. If the tech can improve its dependability, then we see no problem with laws that reflect that. Until then, Florida&#x2019;s self-driving car laws may be a little too loose for comfort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally slips out of work after an especially hard week, feeling the weight of the world lift from her shoulders the moment she parks at the local watering hole. After a couple hours of drinking and chatting it up with friends, it&#x2019;s time to go home. But there is a snag&#x2013;Sally is just over the legal limit. This is the moment that can separate Sally from safety and tragedy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bar none: drinking and driving is one of the most dangerous, careless and negligent actions you can take behind the wheel. Worst of all, as displayed in the example above, it is a fully preventable, unnecessary danger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe the true dangers are not as widely known as we would all hope. </span><a href="http://www.madd.org/drunk-driving/about/drunk-driving-statistics.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every two minutes, a person is injured in a drunk driving accident</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, two out of three people will be involved in a drunk driving crash in their lifetime</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S., there are 27 deaths as a direct result of drunk driving</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 10, 000 people died as a result of drunk driving in 2015</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 300,000 people were injured in drunk driving crashes in 2015</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, 200 children lost their lives in accidents involving alcohol impairment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly &#x2153; of convicted or arrested drunk drivers are repeat offenders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once their license has been suspended, 50-75% of convicted drunk drivers continue to drive</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers are truly sobering, yet as the final two bullets above detail, drunk drivers often not only continue driving, but continue to drink and drive. Current laws, though certainly strict, do not seem to be doing enough to dissuade large portions of those convicted to make better choices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question is, what can be done? If cold, hard facts, fines and the possibility of jail time are not enough, we may have to turn to technology to get the job done.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignition Interlock System Law</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are caught driving under the influence of alcohol, you face the possibility of fines, community service, probation, vehicle impoundment, and imprisonment. Upon multiple convictions (or the injury or death of others as a result of your recklessness), the ramifications only grow steeper. One such a penalty is what is called an ignition interlock system, which is first-time offenders caught with blood alcohol content (BAC) higher than .15 percent or a minor in the vehicle at the time of the stop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these first-time offenders, the current ignition interlock system law mandates that the driver has this device, which is essentially a breathalyzer that will not allow a driver to start their vehicle if their BAC is above the legal limit, installed in their vehicle for six months. For MADD, this law is not enough.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wctv.tv/content/news/MADD-is-One-Step-Closer-to-Expanding-Floridas-Ignition-Interlock-Law-416746663.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of MADD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, House Bill 949 received the go-ahead from a House committee, bringing a new ignition interlock system law into the realm of very real possibility. This new law&#x2019;s cause: make the ignition interlock system mandatory for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">every </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">first offender. Given MADD&#x2019;s stats on just how many people continue to drink and drive after being caught, we cannot help but think they may be onto something good. We will be monitoring this bill closely as it continues advancing toward becoming law.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Law Never Worth Breaking</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line is, drinking and driving is far from a victimless crime. Even if you somehow avoid to damage property or hurt, maim or kill someone in the process, if caught, your life will face significant challenges. From the new financial burden imposed by substantial fines to the potential loss of your vehicle or license, these can impact your life for years after arrest&#x2013;and that is the best-case scenario. If you hurt someone because you simply neglected to call a cab, designate a sober driver or abstain from drinking, that is a guilt and burden that does not go away. Never drink and drive. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric energy is a clean alternative to fossil fuels and is set to be the future of the way we power our world, thanks largely to the investments and innovations provided by Elon Musk and Tesla, Inc. (among others). With climate change concerns, growing air pollution across the world and the fact that gasoline and ethanol are increasingly limited resources, we are in need of this move toward a more battery-powered life if it can be done affordably and safely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there have always been risks of explosions and flammability in automobiles. The infamous Ford Pinto is still known for its fire risks some 40+ years since its debut and some may remember the Ford Explorer/Firestone tire issues of the early 2000s. Unfortunately, though overall car safety has increased over time, today&#x2019;s modern gas-powered cars, hybrids and electric cars still maintain very real risks of car battery explosions that should not be taken lightly. We will take a look at the risks and how to avoid them when hitting the road.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Risk of Car Battery Explosions </span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>&#x201C;Jumping&#x201D; a Car: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Most have experienced the headache of a dead battery. Luckily, reviving a battery is often as simple as clamping jumper cables between a running vehicle and the vehicle with the dead battery. Where the danger lies is in the clamping of these batteries. Be sure to use insulated, undamaged jumper clamps and be sure to clamp first to the dead battery to avoid a potential, dangerous electrical arc. Once clamped to either battery, keep fingers away from the metal portions of the clamp, which will instantly be electrified. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Damage and Corrosion:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A battery that has not been properly maintained is susceptible to corrosion and damage, which can form a bridge that could ignite the battery&#x2019;s hydrogen gas. </span><a href="http://www.autos.com/car-maintenance/how-to-clean-and-prevent-car-battery-corrosion"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean your battery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or replace it, if damaged.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defect:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As we always say, accidents can happen&#x2013;yes, even in production. Always keep an eye out for </span><a href="https://www.recalls.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recalls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially in something as potentially dangerous and regularly used as your vehicle.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accident:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Car accidents, though often avoidable through some safe driving techniques, can happen when you least expect them. In especially some especially serious accidents, car batteries have been known to be punctured or otherwise damaged, catching them on fire.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some venture that a recent deadly accident involving a fully battery-powered Tesla shows the future risks of a predominantly electric-powered-vehicle world. In this case, a 27-year-old woman (who was later found to be intoxicated at the time of the crash) and a 44-year-old man were killed when she crashed the vehicle into a tree after traveling at a high rate of speed. The sporty Tesla Model S reportedly burst into flames, </span><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2017/02/08/tesla-explosion-fire-were-factors-crash-deaths/97641474/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shooting debris into the air like &#x201C;Roman candles&#x201D;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and making the efforts of firefighters and first responders that much more dangerous and difficult. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you currently drive an electric vehicle, you must understand the risk of doing so. The Tesla Model S is powered by a lithium battery pack that weighs in at 1,200 pounds&#x2013;a lot of potential explosive and flammable material. Of course, your standard gas-powered engine possesses similar potential risks of explosion and fire, but the fact that lithium battery fires are tougher to fight is enough to make us cautious. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing you can do to protect yourself and your vehicle, whether gas-powered, electric or a hybrid? Simply follow the rules of the road, drive attentively and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">never</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drive while intoxicated. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the dawn of modern man, fire has been something that we have met with equal reverence and fear. It provides warmth and a means of cooking, but can just as easily burn and destroy if not respected and controlled. In our modern lives, electricity has largely made open flames unnecessary (though some still prefer gas flame ovens). However, homeowners and tenants should not let fire safety go by the wayside, as accidental fires still occur&#x2013;and far more often than you may expect.</span></p>
<p>How can you prevent fires and protect yourself and your family? A bit of fire safety can go a long way.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Safety Advice: Prevention and Reaction</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to fire safety centers around prevention and preparation, both of which are important in equal measure. Fires tend to spark when we least expect them, which leads to panic and a delayed escape that could cost you and your family dearly. The best way to prevent this panicked state is to ensure that your home&#x2019;s fire safety standards are set and a plan is in place if the unexpected occurs. The following tips are especially helpful for parents of children, who may not understand and fully respect the destructive power of an out-of-control fire. &#xA0;</span></p>
<p><b>Prevention:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never place candles in areas with low ceilings, near loose-hanging fabrics (drapes, blankets, towels), or in reach of children.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never leave candles unattended.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not leave cooking food unattended.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure that a fireplace remains cleaned and the vent is open before starting a fire.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Store propane tanks away from open flames and ensure all valves are completely shut.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a habit of double checking gas ovens after use to ensure that they are in the &#x201C;off&#x201D; position.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only store gasoline in </span><a href="http://simplifiedsafety.com/blog/does_your_gas_can_meet_osha_requirements/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSHA- and DOT-approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gas containers, never smoking or approaching with an open flame.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn off portable heaters and keep them safely away from flammable materials.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid smoking indoors, especially in bed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep working fire extinguishers in the house, especially near the kitchen.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though prevention is important, the fact that freak accidents can occur at any moment means that preparation is also needed.</span></p>
<p><b>Preparation:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make an escape plan that allows for two methods of exit from each room and practice fire drills to ensure the entire family knows what to do in an emergency.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every room on every level of your home requires a working smoke alarm. This includes bathrooms.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teach everyone to close their doors to </span><a href="https://closeyourdoor.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">limit the spread of fire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smoke alarms should be tested monthly and have batteries replaced, if necessary.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure that children know to call 9-1-1.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teach all residents the stop, drop and roll technique.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy a fireproof safe to store important documents and heirlooms for safe keeping.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Once a fire is beyond your control, always make your escape the priority. It is tempting to try to grab valuables before making an exit but this is a foolish and potentially deadly mistake. A house fire can cause:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>First degree burns:</strong> Red skin with minor pain on the top layer of skin. Relatively harmless, but still painful.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Second degree burns:</strong> Blistered, extremely painful skin that can take months to fully heal.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Third degree burns:</strong> All layers of the skin are charred, making healing without skin grafts impossible. Pain is not present due to severe nerve damage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Fourth degree burns:</strong> Charred skin, muscle and even bone, this level of injury is life threatening and could easily result in amputation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Smoke inhalation:</strong> Smoke is full of harmful particles, chemicals and more that can permanently damage lungs or cut off oxygen completely.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are renting a property, your landlord is responsible for ensuring that your home is not negligently unsafe from the risk of fire. If you suspect that they voluntarily neglected to ensure fire alarms were in place, gas was not leaking, the fireplace was not obstructed or a number of other fire safety standards were met, you may have a case if a fire has damaged your property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are injured because of the negligence of others, please do not hesitate to contact the </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/personal-injury/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal injury attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Wieland Hilado &amp; DeLattre today. </span></p>

<p>A helmet-to-helmet collision on the football field, a head-on crash during the morning commute or a falling brick from a construction site&#x2013;all of these examples and more are prime examples of the ways a traumatic brain injury can occur in one&#x2019;s life. With March being Brain Injury Awareness Month, we thought it the perfect opportunity to shed a bit of light on what can be devastating and tragic&#x2013;but may also be prevented with a bit of education.</p>
<p>As defined by th<span style="font-weight: 400;">e </span><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/traumatic-brain-injury/basics/definition/con-20029302" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayo Clinic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, &#x201C;Traumatic brain injury occurs when an external mechanical force causes brain dysfunction.&#x201D; To dig deeper, let us examine how these injuries differentiate from others and how they are diagnosed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difficulty with diagnosis is that injuries may not be immediately apparent. Even without signs of injury, trauma to the head and brain can result in death if not treated immediately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a blow to the head or similar trauma, do not hesitate to get medical attention as soon as possible, even if you maintain consciousness and do not think the trip to the doctor is necessary. This is most certainly a &#x201C;better safe than sorry&#x201D; scenario. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When examining someone who has recently suffered a head injury, physicians may apply what is called the </span><a href="http://www.trauma.org/archive/scores/gcs.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glasgow Coma Score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This method of measurement rates eye response, verbal response and motor response and, based on the score collected, can adequately diagnose the severity of injuries, from mild to severe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have a better understanding of how doctors diagnose traumatic brain injuries, let us look into their common causes and ways you may be able to prevent or minimize such injuries yourself.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common Causes of Traumatic Brain Injury</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Sports: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with today&#x2019;s advanced safety equipment, sports accidents occur every day. Helmets can collide during a football game, skateboarders can run into with each other or take an especially bad fall, a baseball player can get hit with the ball or crash into a wall, a hockey player can be hit by the puck or opponent&#x2019;s stick and a boxer can face multiple shots to the head in every round of their bout.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span>Prevention: <span style="font-weight: 400;">These risks are only amplified if athletes do not take advantage of helmets, where available. Skateboarders, football players, cyclists, rollerbladers, hockey players and more should ensure that they are wearing protective helmets certified for their safety, secured properly at all times.</span></b></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slip or Trip and Falls:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Slip or trip and falls can quite easily result in serious injuries, including traumatic brain injury. For this reason, property owners and business owners are required to ensure that their home or place of business is safe by using &#x201C;reasonable care&#x201D;. This includes looking out for spills or slippery surfaces and walkways obstructions and repairing or clearing the walkway to ensure that no one is injured. This danger must also be made apparent through signs and/or verbal indication that there is a risk present. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These accidents are especially dangerous for the elderly, disabled or young, who are often much more susceptible to injury.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><strong>Prevention:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Always heed caution signs, look out for puddles and watch your step, especially in dark areas.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vehicle Crashes:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Though car, truck and motorcycle accidents can be traumatic to victims&#x2019; entire bodies, they can be especially damaging to the brain. The sudden, violent stop that occurs on impact can cause a whipping motion to occur to the head and neck, making the brain collide with the inside of the skull. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><strong>Prevention:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbag technology has literally been a lifesaver when it comes to preventing traumatic brain injury. Even so, drivers should do their due diligence by staying up to date on recalls, as there was an infamous, </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/2016/06/21/is-my-airbag-safe-updates-on-the-recall/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">widespread defect in many airbags</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#xA0;just last year. Motorcycle riders should wear helmets at all times, as even a low-speed collision can have deadly results when on two wheels.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seatbelts are also a must whenever operating a car or truck, as they reduce the chance of ejection or head trauma within the vehicle itself. Outside of these safety measures, simply driving with safety and the laws of the road in mind can help prevent collisions in the first place.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traumatic brain injury is often preventable. Through the utilization of helmets in sports, watching one&#x2019;s footing and using seat belts in conjunction with overall safe driving, we can all reduce these horrific and, many times, life-altering injuries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you or a loved one face any level of head trauma, please do not delay in getting medical attention. Once treated, contact our team of personal injury attorneys to receive the compensation you are owed from the negligent party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay safe out there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have examined the impact that car accidents can have on their victims. From the financial drain of emergency room visits and days or weeks missed at work, to the physical toll that very well may include permanent, life-altering injury, accidents can be traumatic experiences, to say the least.</span></p>
<p>This trauma is only compounded in the case of a hit and run accident, in which one party involved in the crash flees the scene before fulfilling their statutory duties. What would compel someone to leave before police can be notified and driver information can be traded? So often, those who run are uninsured or underinsured, under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or simply do not feel like being inconvenienced by the stop. Regardless of reasoning, the penalties for a hit and run accident are severe&#x2013;as they should be.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida&#x2019;s Hit and Run Accident Law</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you decide to run from the scene of an accident, you will have made a possibly bad situation much worse, regardless of whether you caused the accident or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.flhsmv.gov/safety-center/driving-safety/hitrun/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, penalties for running from an accident are as follows:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If accident causes </span><b>property damage</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is considered a second-degree misdemeanor, punishable by up to 60 days in jail and $500 fine.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If accident causes </span><b>injuries</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is considered a second-degree or third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison, $5,000 fine and a license revocation of at least three years.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If accident causes</span><b> fatalities</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is a first-degree felony, punishable by a license revocation of at least three years and a mandatory minimum sentence of four years in prison but the possibility of up to 30 years, and a $30,000 fine.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why such harsh charges from fleeing the scene of an accident? It comes down to saving lives. Many times, if the party who&#xA0;fled simply stayed at the scene they might have saved the lives of the other accident victims by calling 911 and attending to the injured.&#xA0;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to Do if the Other Driver Runs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are involved in an accident and the other party decided to flee, there are a few things that you can do to ensure they are found and held accountable. The first step is preparation and prevention. Always drive according to rules of the road, fully stopping at stop signs, obeying posted speed limits and driving with eyes glued to the road instead of a cell phone screen. As you will see, it is also a good idea to have a pen and notepad within arms reach at all times as well. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dos and Do Nots if the Other Driver Flees</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Do <span style="font-weight: 400;">grab a pen and pad or your cell phone to quickly record the make and model of car and license plate number.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do <span style="font-weight: 400;">record additional information about the car and driver, such as what they looked like, visible damage to the vehicle and details of how the accident occurred. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not <span style="font-weight: 400;">chase down the other driver. Doing so could pose a danger to yourself and others on the road.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do <span style="font-weight: 400;">take photos of the accident scene and any damage to your car and other property.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do <span style="font-weight: 400;">immediately call 911 to report the hit and run accident.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not <span style="font-weight: 400;">accept cash offers from the other party in exchange for not reporting the accident.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not<span style="font-weight: 400;"> assume that you escaped the accident uninjured if you do not immediately feel symptoms.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do <span style="font-weight: 400;">ask witnesses to provide a statement to the authorities.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Injuries can come on hours after the accident occurs. Always seek immediate medical attention and never make assumptions&#x2013;it is always better to report the accident to authorities as you may not know the full extent of damage to your vehicle and your body until days after the crash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the moments after an accident, emotions are high and it is very easy to make a mistake that could endanger all involved. Though your initial compulsion may be to chase this person down to make sure they face the punishment they deserve, this is highly advised against. When someone flees the scene, they will often drive erratically and above the speed limits. If you follow suit, not only are you also breaking the law, but also increasing the risk of yet another accident involving a wholly innocent party. </span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, people are also dangerously unpredictable, and you never know if the person you choose to pursue is brandishing a firearm or is under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Leave the policing to the authorities.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, by collecting accurate information in a notepad, recording photo or video evidence and requesting the help of eyewitnesses, you can do your part to help the police track down the responsible party and bring them to justice. &#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you or a loved one are injured due to the negligence of another driver, please do not hesitate to contact our </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/auto-accidents/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">car accident lawyers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving under the influence usually refers to operating a vehicle while inebriated, but what many drivers fail to realize is there are other, equally dangerous influences that can spell danger for everyone on the road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever driven while tipsy? Have you ever sent a text message while driving or nearly nodded off while behind the wheel? All of the above are easily avoided and could, with as much ease, cause the injury or death of yourself, your passengers and nearby motorists and pedestrians. Each can be dangerous when driving. Read on to learn more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 Deadly Influences When Behind the Wheel</span></h2>
<p><b>Alcohol:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We all know drinking and driving is incredibly negligent and selfish behavior, yet many are caught inebriated behind the wheel every year. As alcohol and certain drugs can lower one&#x2019;s inhibitions and diminish good judgment, it is easy to see how one too many cocktails can lead to the impulse. However, it is the individual&#x2019;s personal responsibility to everyone on the road to take a moment to think before they drink and arrange for a designated driver or utilize a ride-sharing app instead of pointlessly risking it all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you are confident that you can make the drive home without incident, remember the penalties if caught over the legal limit. For a first-time offense, those convicted of a DUI face:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 hours of community service</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$250-$500 fine</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to one year of probation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to six months of jail time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to nine months of jail time with a BAL of .08 or higher with a minor in the vehicle</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minimum 180-day license revocation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12 hours of DUI school</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the above </span><a href="http://www.dmvflorida.org/florida-dui.shtml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">penalties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are assuming you do not harm people or property while driving under the influence. The penalties only get worse from here. Especially considering that Florida has quite a minimal option for public transportation, losing one&#x2019;s license may result in work and personal issues, only complicating matters further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not worth risking the strict penalties laid down by the law, nor the risk of hurting yourself or others due to a lack of proper planning. </span></p>
<p><b>Distractions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our current high-tech lifestyles are something straight out of science fiction of days past thanks largely to our cell phones. Through social media, text messages, phone calls, emails and more, our attention is constantly being demanded in multiple places at the same time. The problem? Driving requires your complete attention at all times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking your eyes off the road for mere seconds is enough to risk a serious accident. Risks like cyclists, pedestrians unexpectedly crossing the road, roadway construction, stopped vehicles and more could easily spell disaster if your eyes are not fixed on the road, as they should be. </span></p>
<p>Though Florida does not consider texting while driving a stoppable offense, it may result in a fine if stopped for another reason. However, if texting or other distracted driving is found to be the cause of an accident, especially one that results in injury or death, you will correctly be found negligent.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in today&#x2019;s world of constant connection, you must put driving safety above your texting and social media habits. If you can&#x2019;t resist the urge to check your phone, silence it and put it in your glove box until you safely arrive at your destination. </span></p>
<p><b>Sleep Deprivation: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">They often say that sleep is not something to take for granted. We may stay up late watching our favorite TV shows, reading an especially gripping novel or even pulling a late night at the office, but that morning grogginess can spell disaster if not kept in check. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving drowsy has strikingly similar symptoms to drinking and driving, including a lack of focus on the road, impaired decision making and affected vision. In fact, according to the </span><a href="https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/drowsy-driving-vs-drunk-driving-how-similar-are-they" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Sleep Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after 18 hours without sleep, you drive like you have a blood alcohol level of .05. After 24 hours, driving is reduced to that of someone at .10.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though there are not specific laws that regulate how much sleep non-professional drivers must get before hitting the road, it is highly advised that one gets a full night&#x2019;s rest before a long drive, taking breaks when necessary, drinking caffeine to help with drowsiness and driving during the morning and day instead of nighttime hours when possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it may sound something akin to what a concerned mother may preach, being rested can truly save lives when it comes to roadway safety.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Safest Route</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us enjoy adult beverages, most are attached at the hip to their cell phones and even more fail to get a full night&#x2019;s rest. Our responsibility to ourselves and all those we share Florida&#x2019;s roadways with is to ensure we are never driving under the influence of any of these potential risks. Never drink and drive, ignore those text messages and get to bed early. By doing so, you are actively making our roads safer for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are involved in an accident due to another&#x2019;s reckless driving, please do not hesitate to contact our </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/auto-accidents/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">car accident attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> immediately.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive safely.</span></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2993" src="http://www.whdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/d-06efcyngu-adrian-flores-1024x683.jpg" alt="Florida&apos;s Bicycle Laws" width="1024" height="683" srcset="http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/d-06efcyngu-adrian-flores-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/d-06efcyngu-adrian-flores-450x300.jpg 450w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/d-06efcyngu-adrian-flores-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helmets save lives; in this fact, there is little room for debate. However, according to Tallahassee&#x2019;s </span><a href="http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Florida-1-for-Motorcycle-Fatalities-370981991.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WCTV.tv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one in seven motorcycle riders do not wear a helmet and account for 19% of fatal accidents. This figure is staggering, considering that motorcycle riders account for only 7% of all motorists in Florida. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond motorcycles, however, helmets still make a tremendous difference in personal safety. A </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/bicycle/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Disease Control report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that over 900 bicyclists were killed and there were an estimated 494,000 emergency room visits due to bike-related injuries in one year alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the dangers above should be enough to influence cyclists and motorcycle riders to forego perfect hair for skull and brain protection, there are also laws in place to further hammer home the point. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida&#x2019;s Helmet Laws</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The laws of physics often work against those in an accident. A sudden stop after traveling at high speeds leaves a body wanting to continue travel, which can lead to serious-to-fatal injuries. In a car or truck, the human body is protected by a combination of seat belts, airbags and the frame of the vehicle itself. A seat belt prevents a driver from being ejected from the vehicle, the frame absorbs some of the impact and the airbags provide protection from head trauma. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with all of these protective assets, people are still injured and killed in car accidents every day. &#xA0;</span></p>
<p>Realize that motorcycle riders and bicyclists are not provided any of the above safety features. It becomes obvious why helmets would be enforced by law, yet many do not know the details on Florida&#x2019;s helmet laws.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motorcycles</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though one may expect, given the data and common sense, that helmets would be mandatory by law. However, as Florida&#x2019;s helmet laws stand, motorcycle riders over the age of 21 may ride without a helmet as long as the rider has insurance covering at least $10,000 in medical benefits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teens 16 or older operating or riding a 50cc motorcycle, one rated at two brake horsepower or less, or one incapable of exceeding 30 miles per hour on level ground are also exempt from the helmet mandate. The same general rules apply for moped operation, dictating that persons under 16 cannot do so without a helmet that complies with </span><a href="https://one.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/pedbimot/motorcycle/unsafehelmetid/pages/page2.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Motorcycle Vehicle Safety Standard 218</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If caught disobeying Florida&#x2019;s helmet laws, operators and riders may face a noncriminal traffic infraction, possibly leading to a hefty ticket. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bicycles</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like motorcycles, bicycles provide little to no protection against something like a speeding motor vehicle. Also, taking into consideration risks such as potholes, road obstructions, pedestrians and dangerous weather changes, wearing a helmet while riding a bike simply makes sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the eyes of the law, again, Florida&#x2019;s helmet laws are very similar to their motorcycle counterparts&#x2019;. Riders and passengers under 16 years of age are required to wear a fitted and fastened helmet that meets federal safety standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If caught, cyclists can face anything from a verbal warning to a citation, which is often dismissed with proof of helmet purchase.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Responsibility</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Florida&#x2019;s helmet laws are not what many would consider stringent, riders and operators owe it to themselves and their loved ones to take this simple step toward safety. Added to a strict following of traffic laws and safe driving/riding techniques, lives can be saved every day on the roadways across the Sunshine State. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though some complain that helmets restrict visibility, there is an extremely diverse list of sizes and styles that can work for any </span><a href="http://www.helmets.org/types.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cyclist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://fortnine.ca/en/types-of-motorcycle-helmets/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">motorcycle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> operator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, not everyone follows high safety standards while on the road. If you are injured due to the negligence of another motorist, please do not hesitate to contact our team of motorcycle accident and personal injury lawyers immediately. We can help ensure you receive the compensation you are owed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abstain from drinking and driving? Look twice for motorcycles? Drive within posted speed limits? </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/2016/12/20/smartphone-wonderful-tech-dangerous-distraction/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignore text messages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when on the road? If you answer &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to these driving safety questions, you are well on your way to making the road a less dangerous place for yourself and those you share it with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, not all of us can truthfully say that they follow the strict standards listed above. We all know that actions like drinking and driving, speeding and distracted driving can all have deadly results, yet so many car accidents involving those examples and more occur on a daily basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since one can only be assured of their own safety standards, it is better to be prepared for the worst than assume the driver in an adjacent lane is responsible. Defensive driving is something many employ to add an extra layer of protection against the unknown, anticipating sudden stops, giving cars more room than necessary and steering clear of drivers who are driving erratically. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the most keenly aware driver cannot avoid every car accident. In the unfortunate case that you are involved in a crash, here are a few things&#xA0;to avoid in the moments to months after the accident.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Not to Do After a Car Accident</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Skip 911:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There is sometimes a temptation to avoid getting the police involved in an accident, especially one that is minor. Who wants to go through the hassle of waiting for an officer to get to the scene, create a report and contact the insurance companies? However, skipping this step, even in minor accidents, can leave you unprotected and without a case if injuries become apparent in the coming days or car damage is more extensive than first assumed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is far better to be safe than sorry when simply calling the authorities can provide both parties with a detailed, unbiased police report that can be used in court, if necessary.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Lose Your Temper: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the shock of the car accident wears off, anger is an extremely common emotional response, especially in the driver who feels the other motorist was at fault. Instead of letting road rage get the best of the situation, it is best to ensure that all involved are not seriously injured and are safely out of the active roadway and away from the damaged vehicles. Though rare, there is always a chance of fire or explosion after a serious accident. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assaulting the other driver, even verbally, will make the situation much worse for all involved. Keep calm, cool and collected, and focus on safety instead of finger pointing.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Forget to Take Photos and Get Info: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking photos of the scene of the accident can be vital to your case if it goes to court. Document damage to all cars and property involved, as well as any injuries that may have been suffered. If there are witnesses of the car accident, secure their contact info as well.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than photos, be sure to ask the other party for their full name, address and insurance provider information (name and policy number). Document the other driver&#x2019;s make, model and color of car, as well as their license plate number.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Incriminate Yourself: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after an car accident, those involved are often understandably shaken up and confused. Avoid saying anything that may be used as an admission of guilt. Yes, even a simply &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry&#x201D; could have unintended consequences.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be especially careful not to speak to the other party&#x2019;s insurance company before contacting an attorney. Insurance companies are only looking to provide you with the least amount of compensation as possible, and will take full advantage of a statement provided while still recovering from the trauma of an accident.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Run from the Crash: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the severity of the crash and responsibility therein, any driver who decides to </span><a href="http://traffic.findlaw.com/traffic-tickets/leaving-the-scene-of-an-accident-hit-and-run.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flee the scene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has also decided to make their situation unnecessarily much worse. Doing so is a crime and can result in everything from a ticket to serious jail time.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hard to know exactly how to handle one&#x2019;s self after a car accident, but if you know what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to do, you are that much closer to being prepared. Continue to drive with care, obey all of the rules of the road and keep these tips in mind&#x2013;just in case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are injured in a car accident, please do not hesitate to contact one of our </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/auto-accidents/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal injury lawyers </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">today.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have seen the influx of red and pink boxes of chocolates lining the grocery store aisles, along with an army of stuffed animals and oversized cards. Book those dinner reservations, stock up on romantic candles and pick a nice pinot&#x2013;it is nearly Valentine&#x2019;s Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it may not seem especially dangerous, there are many important Valentine&#x2019;s Day safety tips you may want to add to your date plans come February 14. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valentine&#x2019;s Day Safety Tips to Add to Your Date Plans</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Candlelight: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, it is romantic to light the room with the warm, flickering flame of candles or oil lamps, but do so with extreme caution. Never leave an open flame unattended, ensure that all flames are safely placed away from flammable fabrics and are not directly under objects that may catch fire.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If placed on a dinner table, keep candles centered safely away from the edge and watch your arms and sleeves when reaching over the table.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Alcohol: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Another holiday, another excuse to have an extra glass or two of that adult beverage than you normally might. As we have cautioned countless times, please enjoy alcoholic beverages responsibly. Though you may want to enjoy a romantic bottle of wine with the one you love, do the right thing by ensuring neither of you drive afterward.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drinking and driving, even if &#x201C;only tipsy&#x201D;, lowers a driver&#x2019;s reaction time and judgement. Getting behind the wheel after drinking not only puts the driver at risk, but everyone else who is on the road, including pedestrians and cyclists. Never make the selfish decision to drink and drive, especially considering a ride share service or taxi is only an app or call away.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Pet Protection: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogs may be man&#x2019;s best friend, but Fido (as well as cats) can be a bit hard to handle with Valentine&#x2019;s Day festivities in full swing. Chocolate, alcohol, coffee and many other foods can be especially dangerous for your pets. Be sure to keep you boxed chocolates safely stored away from your dog or cat, clean up spilled alcohol immediately and do not leave coffee or tea unattended. Curiosity can quite literally kill your dog or cat.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Food Safety: <span style="font-weight: 400;">A common Valentine&#x2019;s Day date plan is to forego the long wait times of restaurants for a home-cooked meal. Though a fantastic way to show one&#x2019;s affection, cooking must be done with safety in mind. Before all else, wash hands with soap and warm water for 15-20 seconds to fully kill germs picked up from the likes of cell phones and door knobs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When cooking raw meats, be sure to do so based on the </span><a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/mintemp.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended cooking times and temperatures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> necessary to kill food-borne germs. Never utilize cooking utensils or cutting boards used on raw meat without first fully cleaning them with soap and water. Also, do not forget to thoroughly wash hands and all surfaces that may have come in contact with raw meat. Cross contamination is a very real risk.</span></b></b>After cooking, make sure to do a full clean up, looking for potential spills that could easily lead to a slip and fall. So often, soap or oil will accidentally leak onto a tile floor, leading to a very serious risk of injury.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Gifting: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Some love going all out for their valentine, buying lavish gifts on top of the usual candies and flowers. Unfortunately, gift-giving holidays are also prime opportunities for thieves to strike. Protect yourself by never leaving gift bags or boxes near windows or in cars, where they are easily visible to passersby.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even electronics or jewelry boxes placed outside for garbage pick up can make your home a prime target for burglary. Break down large boxes and keep all garbage hidden in closed garbage cans.</span></b></b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Valentine&#x2019;s Day safety may seem secondary to setting a romantic mood for that special someone, being smart about everything from cooking to responsible drinking. Never let a holiday become an excuse to bypass the safety standards you keep throughout the year. After all, there is nothing romantic about the risk of injury or illness when trying to show your valentine a good time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you, a loved one or friend </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are injured due to the negligence of others, please do not hesitate to reach out to our team of </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/personal-injury/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal injury attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at 407-841-7699.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though characters such as Superman and Captain America may be relegated to comic books and the silver screen, we do have real-life superheroes amongst us in the form of first responders and law enforcement officers. Assisting during medical emergencies, freak accidents and fires, as well as curbing crime, are all within the realm of responsibility for these selfless professionals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We respect and value their service to our society by thanking them when we see them in uniform, donating to sponsored charities and even covering a lunch or coffee tab from time to time. However, there is one more deeply important thing that we can do to help these men and women perform their jobs safely and efficiently&#x2013;namely, follow the Florida Move Over Law.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the Florida Move Over Law?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though we recently covered</span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/2017/01/24/pedestrian-safety-americas-dangerous-state-walkers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how dangerous Florida is for pedestrians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its roads can also be perilous for first responders, who are often tasked to drive at high speeds and forego some of the rules of the road that we ordinarily follow. It is not uncommon to see a firetruck, ambulance or police car roll through an intersection when they face a red light, blaring their sirens and flashing emergency lights to alert other motorists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one might suspect, they do this to get to those in need as soon as possible. A burning home or someone suffering from heart palpitations cannot afford their first responder to patiently wait at a red light. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though most of us are taught to pull to the side of the road to allow the first responder to pass, many may not know the specifics of the Florida Move Over Law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This law dictates that drivers do the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If on a one-lane road, drive 20 mph under the posted speed limit when approaching an emergency vehicle with lights flashing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If on a one lane road, drive 5 mph when approaching an emergency vehicle with lights flashing on a road with a speed limit of 25 mph or lower</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move over a lane on two-lane roads or highways</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be prepared to stop if in the lane closest to the emergency vehicle</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To sum up, one must either move over a lane, if possible, or slow down when approaching an active first responder&#x2019;s vehicle. Doing so can go a long way in protecting these professionals who are often forced to work adjacent to dangerous, high-speed roadways on a daily basis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Happens if I Do Not Follow the Move Over Law?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether out of impatience or ignorance, if someone does not follow the Move Over Law, they face the following consequences:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 points on license</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ticket</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fine</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potentially putting the lives of first responders and everyone else on the road at risk</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the Move Over Law is relatively easy to understand, one must also apply it to a few common sense safety standards when noticing an approaching emergency vehicle. If the approaching vehicle is coming from behind, pull over and stop on the side of the road, allowing the emergency personnel to safely pass. Also remember that </span><a href="http://alerts.nationalsafetycommission.com/2010/07/emergency-vehicles-right-of-way-and.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emergency vehicles always have the right of way</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep a safe distance with emergency vehicles as well, as they may stop or turn expectedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pairing both the Move Over Law to common-sense safety when near or approaching first responders can protect both emergency workers and those they are attempting to serve. Always drive safely, avoid distractions and never drink and drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing so may just save a life, or help those who are attempting to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more on the Move Over Law, visit </span><a href="http://www.dmvflorida.org/move-over-law.shtml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida&#x2019;s DMV website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walking&#x2013;it is an easy, often pleasant way to decrease stress, burn a few calories and get some much-needed fresh air after a stifling day in the office. Even for those of us with disabilities or aging out of vigorous aerobic exercises, walking can help many stay active without risking injury from overexertion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, thinking that walking the streets of any Florida town without risk of injury (or even death) is a dangerous mistake that many make every day. Though Florida may be known for sunny beaches, orange groves and Disney World, we also have the unfortunate distinction of being the most dangerous state for pedestrians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more startling is the fact that Central Florida&#x2019;s cities Orlando, Kissimmee and Sanford are collectively ranked in as the third worst metropolitan area for pedestrian safety in the country, according to a </span><a href="https://smartgrowthamerica.org/dangerous-by-design/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with these facts, it is vital to educate yourself on safe practices that you should incorporate into your next walk, whether it be around the block or for miles on end. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Pedestrian Safety Tips Do I Need to Follow in Florida?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Eyes Up:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many pedestrians are guilty of spending more time with their eyeballs glued to their cell phones instead of watching their surroundings. The cell phone should never interfere with common pedestrian safety standards, such as keeping your eyes on your walking path, looking for fellow pedestrians, uneven sidewalks and crosswalks.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Crosswalk This Way:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Crosswalks save lives. It is unthinkable as to why, on many busy streets across Central Florida, you can find pedestrians weaving through cars and sprinting to medians, just to play a game of chicken with oncoming cars. Even more confounding is the fact that clearly marked crosswalks may be just feet from where they decided to risk their lives. Please, take the time to walk to a crosswalk and wait for the signal before crossing a road.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Bring a Light at Night:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Once the sun drops, so does visibility. If walking at night, wear bright, reflective clothing and consider wearing or carrying a flashlight, especially in areas with limited streetlights. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, never assume that drivers or cyclists see you. Walk defensively.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impetus for improved pedestrian safety is not solely on the pedestrian, however. Drivers can also do their part by:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. These will slow your reaction time and judgment behind the wheel.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying off of cell phones and avoiding distractions while driving, as you may miss a stop sign, traffic light or pedestrian running across the road.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making a complete stop before turning right on red traffic lights, checking for oncoming pedestrians and bicyclists who may be obscured by light poles or shrubbery. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stopping well ahead of crosswalk lines, giving pedestrians enough room to cross. Stopping in the middle of a designated crosswalk forces pedestrians to walk into traffic or weave behind your vehicle&#x2013;both of which put the pedestrian in danger.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following common rules of the road, making complete stops at stop signs, staying within speed limits and keeping eyes on the road.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never forget that Florida&#x2019;s roadways are infamous for their danger to pedestrians. If it all possible, always walk on sidewalks and in well-lit areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walking is still a stellar way to stretch your legs and stay healthy all year long&#x2013;just ensure that you do so with caution and care. By wearing bright colors, utilizing crosswalks, and keeping your eyes and ears open, you may avoid a serious injury and equally serious hospital bill. When not walking, do your part to be a responsible driver&#xA0;for&#xA0;other pedestrians. In the unfortunate case that you are injured while on a walk, do not hesitate to reach out to a </span><a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/personal-injury/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal injury attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who is ready to help you fight for your claim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you, a friend or a loved one are unfortunately injured as a result of negligence by a governmental agency or have any questions, do not hesitate to contact Wieland, Hilado &amp; DeLattre, P.A. at 407-841-7699. &#xA0;For additional resources, keep checking our blog, LIKE us on </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/whdattorneys" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and follow us on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/whdjustice" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more helpful hints and to always be informed about best practices in law.</span></p>

TITLE: 911 Operator Negligence
DATE: 01/20/2017

<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2961" src="http://www.whdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mind-1783826_1920-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mind-1783826_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mind-1783826_1920-450x300.jpg 450w, http://www.wdjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mind-1783826_1920-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>Can a negligence claim be successfully brought against a 911 operator? &#xA0;The answer is &#x201C;yes,&#x201D; however, it needs to be obvious that a special relationship existed between the plaintiff and the 911 operator.</p>
<p>In a Florida case from 1990, the court found that a special relationship existed between the decedent and the 911 operator when the decedent&#x2019;s ex-wife called 911 to notify the 911 operator that her ex-husband&#x2019;s medical condition was worsening. The 911 operator failed to dispatch emergency personnel, even after assuring the ex-wife that help was on the way.</p>
<p>The facts in a recent case were different, however, during which the decedent&#x2019;s wife called 911 to report that her husband was having a difficult time breathing. The 911 operator advised that help was on the way and began asking questions about the decedent&#x2019;s condition. After the decedent&#x2019;s condition worsened, the 911 operator advised the wife to, &#x201C;just leave him alone,&#x201D; until help arrived. Emergency personnel arrived and performed CPR but the decedent died.</p>
<p>In the complaint, the wife alleged negligence against the 911 operator, claiming that the operator misled the wife about how serious her husband&#x2019;s condition was during the call and negligently instructed the wife not to do anything.</p>
<p>Here, the Florida Court held that for there to be a valid claim against the 911 operator for governmental tort liability, there must be either a common law (case law) duty or a duty under a Florida Statute. Governmental tort liability is broken down into four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activities including legislative, permitting&#xA0;and licensing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Enforcement of law and protection of the public safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>For any activities under these two categories, there is no common law (case law) duty; however, liability can still exist if a special relationship exists between the decedent and the governmental actor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Capital impeachments and property control operators.</li>

<p>Under categories three and four, liability exists except for those activities involving planning or judgment.</p>
<p>In the recent Florida case described above, the court inserted the 911 operator&#x2019;s actions into category three and further found that the plaintiff did not successfully establish a special relationship between the decedent and the 911 operator. Despite no special relationship, the decedent&#x2019;s wife tried to argue that the 911 operator&#x2019;s actions increased the risk of harm to her husband because the operator instructed the wife to do nothing until paramedics arrived. However, the court disagreed and found that the 911 operator never controlled the situation and, therefore, did not increase the risk of harm.</p>
<p>As discussed in previous blogs, negligence claims against government entities are often confusing, difficult and met with many roadblocks along the way.</p>

<p>Mr. Wieland and Mr. Hilado handle workers&#x2019; compensation claims based on injuries caused in places of work. Oftentimes, these injuries occur because of an unsafe workplace, the negligence of a co-worker or the negligence of a third party.</p>
<p>Florida <a href="http://www.whdjustice.com/areas-of-practice/workers-comp/" target="_blank">workers&#x2019; compensation</a> law and statutes provide&#xA0;a strict liability of compensation for injured workers. This means that, essentially, if you are injured while at work, you are entitled to recover workers&#x2019; compensation benefits, regardless of who is at fault. In exchange, the injured worker is generally prevented from bringing a negligence claim against his or her employer or co-workers. Only in rare instances is an injured worker able to collect workers&#x2019; compensation benefits and successfully bring a negligence lawsuit against his employer.</p>
<p>However, what if someone is injured on the job and the injured worker is denied workers&#x2019; compensation benefits? At this point, can the injured worker sue the employer for negligence?</p>
<p>The answer is &#x201C;yes&#x201D; depending on the reason for the denial.</p>
<p>In one recent Florida case, a worker was exposed to hazardous materials and eventually died. The workers&#x2019; compensation insurance company denied his claim, stating, &#x201C;&#x2026;the entire claim is denied as the worker&#x2019;s employment was not the major contributing cause of his death.&#x201D; The appellate court allowed the negligence lawsuit case to continue because the denial was determined to be too vague. If the insurance company&#x2019;s denial would have clearly stated that the injured worker indeed suffered a <u>compensable</u> workers&#x2019; compensation claim specified that their denial was based solely on medical causation or major contributing cause, the injured worker would not have been able to successfully bring a negligence claim against his employer. In this scenario, the injured worker&#x2019;s only remedy would be to bring a workers&#x2019; compensation claim and litigate the medical causation issue through the workers&#x2019; compensation system.</p>
<p>However, if the denial of the workers&#x2019; compensation claim specifically stated that the claim was being denied because the accident did not occur while in the course and scope of his/her employment, or that there was no employment relationship, the employer would be prevented from asserting a workers&#x2019; compensation immunity defense and a negligence lawsuit against the employer could proceed.</p>
<p>The decision over whether an injured worker can successfully bring a negligence claim against his or her employer for a job-related injury is often times determined by the reason for the denial filed by the workers&#x2019; compensation insurance carrier.</p>
<p>At Wieland Hilado &amp; DeLattre, we have represented many clients that have been injured on the job and have been able to collect workers&#x2019; compensation benefits while bringing a negligence claim against a third party. A very common example is when the injured worker slips and falls at work due to the negligence of an outside floor cleaning company.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the injured worker collects and recovers his or her workers&#x2019; compensation benefits and then brings a negligence claim against the outside cleaning company. The outside cleaning company is not immune from liability&#xA0;since they are not connected or related to the employer.</p>
