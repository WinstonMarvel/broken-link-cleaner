BODY:
An energetic and sweet married woman was on her way to a fitness center during her lunch hour from work when she was broadsided by a 18 wheel truck which had run a red light. While she broke many bones in her body the impact caused a traumatic and force fueled injury to her brain. This injury was particularly disturbing as she was able to talk and, at times, seemed normal. However, the brain injury made it so she was unable to remember conversations or be able to independently function to take care of herself or others. The settlement allowed her to obtain brain injury therapy that was cutting edge at the time and resulted in some improvement. Unfortunately she is still unable to take care of herself, however a Trust set up to care for her has provided equipment and housing modifications.

BODY:
This case involved nurses attempting to blame an OB for not attending to warning signs during a delivery. The OB indicated he was in the on call sleeping room the entire night and was never called in a timely manner. Lost in this senseless fight was the family of a little girl who was born brain damages for the failure of the nurses and the OB to act and deliver the child appropriately. After researching the records it was apparent the nurses had falsified the records to reflect calls to the OB they never made. Despite all this both Defendants pushed this case to the eve of trial before resolving the matter. The family has utilized the award to provide education, equipment, housing and nursing care to provide for their daughter who is now nearing her teenage years.

BODY:
This was a tragic case of a young, happily married woman who was nearing the end of her second pregnancy when she became ill with strep throat. She went to a local hospital and was admitted with a fever and other abnormalities in her vital signs. Lab work came back which confirmed she was infected however both the nurses and her physician allowed the results to sit on the hospital’s fax machine unchecked. She eventually became even more sick and additional signs of this progression were ignored by the staff and her physician. Her infection forced her into labor where she died as she gave birth to her second child. While remaining one of our most tragic cases, the settlement allowed her two young children and husband to secure college education funds and attempt to rebuild their lives.

BODY:
A young boy was in the hospital for pain in his stomach. A radiology study was being done to determine the cause and possible surgery for it. Because of the pain his breathing was difficult and had to be continually monitored. During the study his family was with him and became concerned that he was not breathing correctly. Despite their protests the staff ignored them and proceeded with the study. He ultimately stopped breathing completely and suffered brain injury when they were not able to perform CPR in a timely manner because of the delay. Because of the workup and time spent investigating the case, we were able to settle this matter before filing the case. The settlement was used to set up a Trust for the child, enabling him to purchase special equipment and care to take care of his many needs due to his brain injury.

BODY:
A young teenage developed a genetic spinal malformation and was eventually operated on at a local hospital. During the surgery her spinal cord was being monitored by staff to ensure it was not put under undue stress by the procedure. Unfortunately, the obvious signs on the monitor were overlooked by an inexperienced and negligent staff member allowing the surgery to proceed when it should have been stopped. Upon waking up she was found to be permanently paralyzed from the waist level down confining her to a wheelchair. After this settlement she was able to attend an outstanding University which was well known for being handicapped accessible, and now lives in a specially designed home to accommodate and help with her paralysis. She remains and inspirational client with an eye toward some day curing her condition. She is also now contemplating law school to help others.

BODY:
This remains the largest verdict in Miami County history. Jill and Nathan Casto were nearing the end of their pregnancy with their second child when she began to experience a decrease in her baby’s movements. This is a well known sign of a decrease in the oxygen levels to an unborn child. Jill, a very intelligent and caring mom, called her OB numerous times to address this issue. She also visited his office. Both Dr. Holland and his staff continually ignored Jill’s complaints until she eventually gave birth to a dead baby boy several days later. An Autopsy confirmed the boy had his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, which was causing the lack of oxygen. If he had been properly cared for he would not have died and the family would have had their second child. Jill and Nathan have gone on to have another child.

A young woman was not properly diagnosed in the Emergency Room as well as on the floor of a hospital leading to continued seizure activity. Unfortunately this caused permanent brain injury and led to the necessity of physical therapy and other home based care. This case was resolved after various experts were hired and a settlement demand was made prior to filing a lawsuit. The settlement was able to provide much needed medical care and even a trust to help treat the condition for the remainder of the client’s lifetime.

This case was a tragedy but was fortunately settled before a lawsuit had to be filed. A young woman died after a short stay in the hospital due to an undiagnosed infection. She left behind a husband and two children they had together. Due to the settlement we were able to provide college and retirement funds for the boys and the surviving spouse, respectively. While the compensation doesn’t begin to make up for the loss, it was put to good use to advance the family and provide them security for education and allow child care help as well.

This remains one of the most disturbing cases we've ever handled. The client’s were a happy and close knit family whose father had heart surgery. After surgery his wound became infected and was being treated with another operation. During the evening his wound began bleeding slowly but obvious signs were there. The nurse on staff that night was new and ignored the signs of bleeding. In addition, she later changed her records in an attempt to avoid liability. An expert in chart alterations was hired who caught her in this attempt. Despite the chart alteration and the obvious and gross negligence, the Defendant’s fought and the case was not settled until years later and the week before trial.

Mr. Woodruff, a married man with numerous children, was admitted to LMH to have a procedure. While there he was placed on a ventilator after the procedure was completed. He began to show signs of a decrease in oxygen which was ignored by the nursing staff. In fact, they attempted to blame a physician for not responding to their alleged complaints. Eventually, because he was being deprived of oxygen, Mr. Woodruff became disorientated and he dislodged his breathing tube which caused him to go into arrest. This was also mismanaged and led to his eventual death. An Allen County Jury provided this award, which at the time was the largest verdict in the County’s history.

BODY:
A 59 year old woman just completed successful heart transplant surgery and was set to be discharged home. She developed shortness of breath and an x-ray confirmed fluid had collected around one of her lungs. A simple procedure needed to be done to drain the fluid and allow her to breath easier. The x-ray was ordered in the early morning hours by a Resident and then not properly communicated to various Attending physicians who saw her later that same day. Both Attending physicians failed to appreciate the x-ray findings and her condition began to deteriorate. Unfortunately she suffered a respiratory arrest when the fluid was not drained which left her with brain damage. She was unable to care for herself independently and required attention by her children at all times. This matter was settled a few weeks before trial and allowed for a Trust to be set up to pay for home nursing care, medical equipment and home modifications for her to live safely.

Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear and Attorney General Jack Conway have called for a bipartisan effort to pass House Bill 4, a law that takes aim at illegal pill mills and prescription drug abuse, an epidemic that kills about 1,000 Kentuckians each year, according to The Courier-Journal.<br /><br />&#8220;Every day that we delay strengthening our response to prescription drug abuse is another opportunity for a Kentuckian to fall victim to this devastating scourge,&#8221; Beshear said. In fact, since the beginning of this year alone, more than 400 people have been hospitalized due to overdoses.<br /><br />Something clearly needs to be done as the state has the sixth-highest rate of prescription overdose deaths in the nation, but the law does not come without controversy.<br /><br />A call to action was issued to doctors by the Kentucky Medical Association regarding provisions in the bill that could possibly lead to privacy infringements and excessive oversight of legitimate medical practices, not to mention any reluctance from doctors to provide pain medication to legitimate patients.<br /><br />The Kentucky Medical Association issued a &#8220;call to action&#8221; for doctors to contact lawmakers and express concerns over several hallmark provisions in the bill, which critics say could infringe on privacy and lead to excessive oversight of legitimate medical practices. Read the complete details here:<br /><br /><strong>Interests jockey for influence on Kentucky 'pill mill' bill</strong><br /><br />Steve Crandall, a medical malpractice attorney in the state of Kentucky, believes it is imperative to stop physicians from writing prescriptions for pain pills that are too often abused or sold to those who abuse them, even if it means adjusting privacy rights.<br /><br />&#8220;This is an example of private physicians preventing the government from helping citizens and lowering health care costs by improving care and stopping abusive prescription practices,&#8221; Crandall says.<br /><br /><strong>Please contact Steve Crandall with any of your medical malpractice questions in the state of Kentucky. </strong>

BODY:
The Columbus Dispatch reports that medical malpractice claims dropped by 41 percent between 2005 and 2010, largely impacted by Ohio&#8217;s tort-reform law.<br /><br />The law, signed by Gov. Bob Taft in 2003, may now be having a negative effect on those with legitimate claims, though; after physicians complained that the skyrocketing cost of malpractice insurance premiums were forcing them out of business, a cap was placed on &#8220;pain and suffering&#8221; damages at $500,000 per occurrence, making some cases impractical to pursue.<br /><br />The result of this bill was a record drop in closed claims to 2,988 in 2010, the lowest level since 2005, when the state began keeping records. Average malpractice payments declined by 38 percent over that five-year period, a total of $100 million.<br /><br />Tim Maglione of the Ohio State Medical Association does not believe this decrease is drastic enough, though he adds, &#8220;There is absolutely nothing in the law that closes the courthouse door to anyone that has a legitimate medical liability claim.&#8221; Read the complete details here:<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2012/04/16/lawsuits-against-doctors-have-declined.html">Lawsuits against doctors decline</a></strong><br /><br />Steve Crandall, a top ranked medical malpractice attorney in the state of Ohio, does not believe this law makes any sense; the cap on &#8220;pain and suffering&#8221; does nothing to advance the purported purpose of the law or curb so-called frivolous claims, but rather further harms those patients whom a jury has indicated have meritorious claims and deserve compensation, according to Crandall.<br /><br />&#8220;What it really does is limit the liability of insurance carriers who have no laws on the amount they can charge physicians,&#8221; Crandall says. &#8220;The insurance industry used the physicians to do their bidding and help their business.&#8221;<br /><br />If you have questions about medical malpractice in Ohio, or if you've been impacted by Senate Bill 281, <strong>please contact Steve Crandall with any of your medical malpractice questions. </strong>

<strong>A question that we're often asked is "what is considered medical malpractice in Ohio?"</strong><br /><br />In the state of Ohio, medical malpractice occurs when a medical care provider, whether a physician, nurse, dentist, technician, hospital or nursing home, fails to act as a reasonably prudent care provider would act under same or similar conditions.<br /><br />In a medical malpractice case, the patient must prove two things:<br /><ol><br />    <li>the care provider owed them a duty, and</li><br />  <li>an act or failure to act breached this duty proximately causing them damages.</li><br /></ol><br />The duty starts with a physician-patient or nurse-patient relationship, and it ensures the providers act within the national standard of care for a particular situation.<br /><br />Do you have a potential case that falls into the category of medical malpractice in the state of Ohio?
